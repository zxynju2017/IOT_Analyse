Efficient communication receiver design for Internet of things environment,面向物联网环境的高效通信接收机设计,2020,"Internet of Things (IoT) communication system has the characteristics of small active user number and short data frame,while the pilot and user identification code required by channel estimation and multi-user detection will greatly reduce the communication efficiency and response speed of IoT system.To solve these problems,a blind channel estimation and multi-user detection algorithm based on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) was proposed.Firstly,the spread spectrum matrix in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system was used to allocate the carrier to each user,and the constellation rotation problem caused by blind estimation was solved by differential coding.Secondly,according to the sparsity of carriers allocated to users,the Bernoulli-Gaussian (B-G) distribution was introduced as a prior distribution,and the hidden Markov characteristic between the variables was used to perform the factor decomposition and modeling,and the multi-user identification was carried out based on sparse features of user data.Finally,the above model was deduced by message passing algorithm to solve multi-user interference caused by NOMA,and the joint channel estimation and detection receiver algorithm for IoT environment was obtained.The simulation results show that,compared with Block Sparse Single Measurement Vector(BS-SMV) algorithm and Block Sparse Adaptive Space Pursuit (BSASP) algorithm,the proposed algorithm can achieve a performance gain of about 1 dB without increasing the complexity.","摘要:物联网(IoT)通信系统具有活跃用户数低、数据帧短等特性,而信道估计和多用户识别所需的导频和用户识别码会显著降低IoT系统的通信效率和响应速度。针对上述问题,提出了一种基于非正交多址接入(NOMA)的盲信道估计和多用户检测算法。首先,利用码分多址(CDMA)系统中的扩频矩阵对每个用户所占用载波进行分配,并采用差分编码解决盲估计所引发的星座点旋转问题;其次,根据用户所分配载波具有的稀疏性,引入伯努利-高斯(BG)分布作为先验分布,利用变量间的隐马尔可夫特性进行因式分解和建模,由用户数据的稀疏特征进行多用户识别;最后,应用消息传递算法对上述模型进行推导,解决NOMA引起的多用户干扰,得到面向IoT环境的联合信道估计和检测接收算法。仿真结果表明,相对于块稀疏单测量向量(BS-SMV)算法和块稀疏自适应子空间求解(BSASP)算法,所提算法能够在不提高复杂度的条件下获得约1 dB的性能增益。",作者关键词:Internet of Things (IoT) communication; blind channel estimation; probabilistic graph model; iterative receiver design; Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (CDMA),作者关键词:物联网通信; 盲信道估计; 概率图模型; 迭代接收机设计; 非正交多址接入

Inhibitory effects of organic acids on polyphenol oxidase: From model systems to food systems,,2019,"Organic acids are widely utilized in the food industry for inhibiting the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and enzymatic browning. This review discusses the mechanisms of inhibition of PPO and enzymatic browning by various organic acids based on studies in model systems, critically evaluates the relevance of such studies to real food systems and assesses the implication of the synergistic inhibitory effects of organic acids with other physicochemical processing techniques on product quality and safety. Organic acids inhibit the activity of PPO and enzymatic browning via different mechanisms and therefore the suitability of a particular organic acid depends on the structure and the catalytic properties of PPO and the physicochemical properties of the food matrix. Studies in model systems provide an invaluable insight into the inhibitory mechanisms of various organics acids. However, the difference in the effectiveness of PPO inhibitors between model systems and food systems and the lack of correlation between the degree of PPO inhibition based on in vitro assays and enzymatic browning imply that the effectiveness of organic acids can be accurately evaluated only via direct assessment of browning inhibition in a particular food system. Combination of organic acids with physical processing techniques is one of the most viable approaches for PPO inhibition since the observed synergistic effect helps to reduce the undesirable organoleptic quality changes from the use of excessive concentration of organic acids or intense physical processing.",,作者关键词:Organic acids; polyphenol oxidase; inhibition mechanism; catalytic activity; enzymatic browning; model systems; food systems,

For the first time, the prototype of LoRa BC system based on MCU is demonstrated. Experimental results show that design can successfully realize backscatter communication at any position between the station and the receiver which are 208 meters apart, while being compatible with commodity LoRa chipset.

Transfer Printing of VO2 Thin Films Using MoS2/SiO2 van der Waals Heterojunctions,,2019,"In recent years, flexible electronic devices have attracted much attention due to the potential applications in the fields of the Internet of Things and bioelectronics. The integration of functional oxide materials in flexible polymers has been proven an effective way to achieve high performance flexible electronic devices. However, due to high fabrication temperatures, the synthesis of high-quality oxide films directly on flexible polymer substrates remains a significant challenge. This study proposed a method for transferring printing large-area VO2 film based on MoS2/SiO2 van der Waals heterojunctions. Due to different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of MoS2 and SiO2 films, we can dissociate the MoS2/SiO2 van der Waals heterojunction interface only by using deionized water, and transfer printing the VO2 films from Si/SiO2/MoS2/SiO2/VO2 to Si, SiO2/Si and flexible substrates. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the crystal structure of VO2 films has no difference before and after the transfer process. Temperature-dependent Raman spectrum and infrared reflectance spectrum demonstrate good metal-insulator transition (MIT) performance of VO2 films before and after transferring printing. These results indicate an effective method for transferring printing functional oxide films, which enables low-temperature integration of VO2 thin films on arbitrary substrates without introducing sacrificial layer and corrosive solvents. Our study provides a new way for integrating functional oxides for flexible wearable electronic devices applications.",,作者关键词:vanadium oxide film; transfer printing; low-temperature integration; flexible electronic devices,
Constructions of Maximal Distance Separable Matrices with Minimum XOR-counts,,2019,"With the development of the internet of things, small-scale communication devices such as wireless sensors and the Radio Frequency IDentification(RFID) tags are widely used, these micro-devices have limited computing power, so that the traditional cryptographic algorithms are difficult to implement on these devices. How to construct a high-efficiency diffusion layer becomes an urgent problem. With the best diffusion property, the Maximal Distance Separable (MDS) matrix is often used to construct the diffusion layer of block ciphers. The number of XOR operations (XORs) is an indicator of the efficiency of hardware applications. Combined with the XORs calculation method which can evaluate hardware efficiency more accurately and a matrix with special structure-Toeplitz matrix, efficient MDS matrices with less XORs can be constructed. Using the structural characteristics of the Toeplitz matrix, the constraints of matrix elements are improved, and the complexity of matrices searching is reduced. The 4x4 MDS matrices and the 6x6 MDS matrices with the least XORs in the finite field F-28 are obtained, and the 5x5 MDS matrices with the XORs which are equal to the known optimal results are obtained too.

It is widely known that the nonline-of-sight( NLOS) error will greatly reduce the accuracy of traditional localization algorithm. Therefore,a residual power-square weighted localization algorithm based on target temporary location estimation is proposed to solve this problem. First, the static nodes( SNs) are divided into several subgroups to obtain variable position estimations of target node ( TN),and then define the deviation between these positions as the temporary positioning residual. Different from the traditional residual weighted localization algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the high power of the residual as the weight function and finds the optimal weight function through simulations. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithms when the number of LOS-SN is no less than two. The proposed algorithm is more superior in positioning accuracy to the traditional NLOS suppression localization algorithm. Compared with the traditional residual weighted localization algorithm( RWGH), the proposed algorithm improves the positioning accuracy about 60%,while the requirement of LOS-SN number is reduced. Moreover, in comparing with the semi-definite programming ( SDP ) method,our positioning accuracy increases nearly 38%,and the corresponding complexity is reduced.","摘要:无线定位已成为物联网应用的重要研究内容,为减小非视距( NLOS)误差对传统定位算法的精度的影响。因此提出一种基于目标临时位置估计的残差幂次方加权定位算法。算法核心在于先利用分组定位得到不同目标节点估计位置,并将位置之间的差值定义为临时定位残差。然后区别于传统残差加权定位算法,本文提出用残差的高次幂作为加权函数,并通过仿真搜索最优的加权函数。仿真结果表明,当LOS-SN数目不小于2时,本文算法在定位精度上远高于传统的NLOS抑制定位算法。和传统的残差加权定位算法( RWGH)相比,本文所提算法的定位精度提高了近60%,同时降低了对LOS-SN个数的要求。和半正定规划( SDP)相比,定位精度提高了近38%,并降低了计算复杂度。",作者关键词:wireless localization; non-line-of-sight error; temporary positioning residual; weighting,作者关键词:无线定位; 非视距误差; 临时定位残差; 残差加权

[Deep residual convolutional neural network for recognition of electrocardiogram signal arrhythmias].,,2019,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are easily disturbed by internal and external noise, and its morphological characteristics show significant variations for different patients. Even for the same patient, its characteristics are variable under different temporal and physical conditions. Therefore, ECG signal detection and recognition for the heart disease real-time monitoring and diagnosis are still difficult. Based on this, a wavelet self-adaptive threshold denoising combined with deep residual convolutional neural network algorithm was proposed for multiclass arrhythmias recognition. ECG signal filtering was implemented using wavelet adaptive threshold technology. A 20-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) containing multiple residual blocks, namely deep residual convolutional neural network (DR-CNN), was designed for recognition of five types of arrhythmia signals. The DR-CNN constructed by residual block local neural network units alleviated the difficulty of deep network convergence, the difficulty in tuning and so on. It also overcame the degradation problem of the traditional CNN when the network depth was increasing. Furthermore, the batch normalization of each convolution layer improved its convergence. Following the recommendations of the Association for the Advancements of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), experimental results based on 94 091 2-lead heart beats from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrated that our proposed method achieved the average detection accuracy of 99.034 9%, 99.498 0% and 99.334 7% for multiclass classification, ventricular ectopic beat (Veb) and supra-Veb (Sveb) recognition, respectively. Using the same platform and database, experimental results showed that under the comparable network complexity, our proposed method significantly improved the recognition accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared to the traditional deep learning networks, such as deep Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), CNN, etc. The DR-CNN algorithm improves the accuracy of the arrhythmia intelligent diagnosis. If it is combined with wearable equipment, internet of things and wireless communication technology, the prevention, monitoring and diagnosis of heart disease can be extended to out-of-hospital scenarios, such as families and nursing homes. Therefore, it will improve the cure rate, and effectively save the medical resources.",心电图（ECG）信号在采集过程中容易受内部和外部噪声干扰，而且不同患者的 ECG 信号形态特征差异较大，即使同一患者在不同时间和环境下其 ECG 信号也会有差异，因此 ECG 信号特征检测与识别在心脏病远程实时监测与智能诊断中具有一定难度。基于此，本研究提出将小波自适应阈值去噪和深度残差卷积神经网络算法用于多种心律不齐的信号识别过程中。其中，使用小波自适应阈值技术完成 ECG 信号滤波，并设计了包含多个残差块（residual block）结构的 20 层卷积神经网络（CNN），即深度残差卷积神经网络（DR-CNN），对 5 大类心律不齐 ECG 信号进行了识别。然后，本文采用残差块局部神经网络结构单元构建 DR-CNN，缓解了深层网络的收敛难、调优难等问题，克服了 CNN 随着网络层数增加而导致的退化问题；进一步引入批标准化（batch normalization）技术，保证了网络的平滑收敛。按照美国医疗器械促进协会（AAMI）的心搏分类标准，使用麻省理工学院和波士顿贝丝以色列医院（MIT-BIH）心律不齐数据库中 94 091 个 ECG 心搏信号（2 个导联），完成了心律不齐多分类、室性异位搏动（Veb）和室上性异位搏动（Sveb）等分类识别实验。实验结果表明，本文所提出的方法在 ECG 信号多分类、Veb 和 Sveb 识别中的准确率分别达到了 99.034 9%、99.498 0% 和 99.334 7%。在相同的数据集和实验平台下，DR-CNN 在分类准确率、特异性和灵敏度上均优于相同结构复杂度的 CNN、深度多层感知机等传统算法。DR-CNN 算法提高了心律不齐智能诊断的精度，该方法与可穿戴设备、物联网和无线通信技术相结合，可以将心脏病的预防、监测和诊断延伸到家庭、养老院等院外场景，从而提高心脏病患者的救治率，并且有效地节约医疗资源。.,关键词列表:arrhythmia classification; deep residual convolutional neural network; electrocardiogram; the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation; wavelet adaptive filtering,

Survey on Internet End-to-end Multipath Transfer Research with Cross-layer Optimization,互联网端到端多路径传输跨层优化研究综述,2019,"Recently, with the development of new technologies like virtual reality, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and so on, the user demand on network bandwidth increases sharply, and it is hard to meet user bandwidth demand by making use of single access technology. To solve the contradiction between users' increasing bandwidth demand and limited frequency resources, Internet end-to-end multipath transmission technologies are designed. Internet end-to-end multipath transmission protocols, like MPTCP (multipath TCP), mainly work at transport layer, and they can make use of existing multiple network cards (for example WiFi and 4G) to do concurrent transmission, the total transmission bandwidth and the adaptability to network variation are improved. Since the subflows of MPTCP can realize end-to-end reliable in order delivery based on TCP and its optimizations, research works related to multipath transmission focus on the intelligent coorperations among subflows, the coorperations mainly include subflow selection, data scheduling, coupled congestion control, and so on. Nevertheless, as the estimation of network status at transport layer may not reflect current link state accurately due to the variation of link and physical layer, heterogeneous network interfaces have different resource allocation schemes, different subflows may have partially overlapped paths, the upper application layer have different characteristics in deadline, frame importance, distortion rate, and so on. These will affect the performance of the intelligent coorpertaions among subflows, the advantage of multipath transfer can not be fully exploited by only making use of traditional transport layer information, the information at other layers should also be utilized. So in recent years, many research papers start to make use of physical, link, network, and application layer information to improve multipath transmission performance efficiently with cross layer cooperated optimization. This paper compares the research of multipath transfer optimization with cross layer information, analyzes the relationship between multipath transfer and the function of different layer, and the outlook of future research trends is provided in the end.","摘要:近年来,随着虚拟现实、物联网、云计算等新兴技术的发展,用户对网络带宽的需求迅猛增加,使用单一接入技术已经难以满足用户对网络带宽的需求.为了解决用户日益增长的带宽需求和有限的频率资源之间的矛盾,互联网端到端多路径传输技术应运而生.互联网端到端多路径传输协议,如MPTCP(multipath TCP),目前主要工作于传输层,能够利用终端已经具备的多块网卡(如WiFi网卡和4G网卡)同时进行数据的端到端并发传输,从而提高总的传输带宽和对网络动态性的适应能力.由于每条子流可以通过TCP协议及其优化算法实现端到端的可靠有序传输,因此端到端多路径传输的研究重点在于多条子流之间的智能协同,主要体现在子流选择、数据分配和调度、联合拥塞控制等方面.然而,底层链路的动态变化使得传输层所估计的链路参数无法及时地反映当前链路的状态,异构物理网络接口具有不同的资源分配特点,不同子流在网络层存在部分传输路径重合问题,上层应用的数据包在截止时间、重要性、失真率等方面存在差异,这些都将给端到端多路径传输中子流之间的智能协同带来影响.因此,仅仅依靠传统的传输层信息无法有效发挥多路径传输的优势,需要在传输层对其他层次的相关参数进行有效利用.为此,近年来有关研究着手利用物理层、链路层、网络层以及应用层的相关信息,通过跨层联合优化来有效地提升多路径传输的优势.比较了近年来利用跨层信息进行多路径传输优化的研究,分析了各层的功能特点及其与多路径传输的关系,并在最后对未来的研究趋势进行了展望.",作者关键词:SDN; end-to-end multipath transmission; cross layer optimization; link state sensing; route selection; SDN; video transmission; energy saving,作者关键词:端到端多路径传输; 跨层优化; 链路状态感知; 路由选择; 视频传输; 节能

Euler Kernel-based Data Stream Clustering Algorithm,基于欧拉核的数据流聚类算法,2019,"With the advance of both cloud computing and internet of things,many applications generate huge amounts of data streams at fast speed.Examples include real-time surveillance systems,vehicle traffic monitoring systems,electricity consumption recording,and network traffic monitoring.Data stream mining has become a hot research topic.Its goal is to extract hidden knowledge/patterns from continuous data streams.Clustering,one of the most important problems in stream mining,has been highly explored.Different from traditional data clustering algorithm where given datasets are generally static and can be repeatedly read and processed,clustering data streams face more challenges due to having to satisfy such constraints as bounded memory,single-pass,real-time response and concept-drift detection.This paper pre-sented a new clustering algorithm for data streams,called EG-Stream,by combining the Euler kernel method with the Growing Neural Gas(GNG) model.It can not only maintain the benefit of nonlinear modeling using kernel function,but also significantly solve the large scale computational problem in kernel-based clustering.Euler kernel is relying on a nonlinear and robust cosine metric that is less sensitive to outliers.More important,it intrinsically induces an empirical map which maps data onto a complex space of the same dimension,and it takes these advantages to measure the similarity between data in a robust way without increasing the dimensionality of data,which avoids the problem that other kernel clustering algorithms can not deal with data streams.Although this method is embarrassingly simple just by incorporating the Euler kernel into GNG,the experimental results on variety of UCI datasets indicate that this method can still achieve comparable or even better performance than G-Stream algorithm,and identify the structural information from stream data.","摘要:随着云计算、物联网的快速发展,数据采集变得更加快捷和自动化。许多新型的应用领域中,诸如实时监控系统、车辆交通监控系统、电力消耗记录以及网络流量监控等,每时每刻都在产生大量的流数据,对数据流挖掘的研究成为了热点问题。聚类分析作为数据流挖掘领域的一个重要问题,在近期被高度重视并得到广泛研究。不同于传统的静态数据聚类问题,数据流聚类受到有限内存、一遍扫描、实时响应和概念漂移等许多约束。为此,文中基于欧拉核提出了一种针对数据流的聚类算法。首先通过欧拉核显式地将数据映射到相同维度的复数特征空间,然后在特征空间中基于GNG模型进行聚类。欧拉核依赖于非线性鲁棒的cosine度量,故对野值低敏感;显式的映射避免了一般的核聚类算法需要使用核技巧而无法处理数据流的问题。实验数据表明,基于欧拉核的数据流聚类算法不仅表现出了较好的聚类性能,还识别了数据的结构信息。",作者关键词:GNG; GNG; Data stream clustering; Euler kernel; Kernel method,作者关键词:数据流聚类; 欧拉核; 核方法
EasiFFRA: A Fast Feature Reduction Algorithm Based on Neighborhood Rough Set,EasiFFRA:一种基于邻域粗糙集的属性快速约简算法,2019,"Extracting effective features from the high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature set is significant, which is the basis for the prediction and classification of Internet of things (IoT) applications. There are usually multiple sensors deployed in the system and quite a few features are extracted to make full use of the environment information. The high dimensional features always contain redundant and unrelated features, which reduces not only the speed of system, but also the performance of the classification. It's necessary to recognize and delete them. Neighborhood rough set (NRS) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction, which deletes the unrelated and redundant features while keeping the separability of dataset. However, the NRS method has not been widely applied because of the huge computing cost. In this paper, a Easi fast feature reduction algorithm (EasiFFRA) is proposed based on the symmetry of adjacent domain relationships and the decision attribute filtering mechanism, which reduces the redundant computing by preferentially traversing the buckets with relatively concentrated neighbor samples distribution, and stores the samples into a Hash table that cannot belong to the positive region under the current feature subset. Furthermore, this method can reduce the number of distance calculation significantly through filtering the samples which have the same label with the current sample. Moreover, the algorithm validity is verified by a real world dataset, and 12 open datasets are used. The results show that compared with FHARA, EasiFFRA reduces the computing time by 75.45%. EasiFFRA algorithm reduces the effect of unrelated and redundant features on the results of classification and prediction, and enhances the real-time performance of the neighborhood rough set based features reduction method, which has important application value.","摘要:从高维异构感知信息中提取有效特征是支撑物联网系统预测与识别的基础.物联网场景中通常包括多个多种感知节点,系统通常会从感知数据中提取大量特征,其中不乏部分无关和冗余特征.这些无关及冗余特征会降低系统的运行速度,引入冗余计算,更会影响后续的分类及预测等机器学习操作的性能.因而高效识别并提取低维有效的特征子集是物联网数据分析所面临的一大挑战.邻域粗糙集方法能够在保持数据集可分性的前提下,识别和去除无关及冗余特征子集,从而达到降维效果.但由于现有基于邻域粗糙集的特征约简算法的计算开销大、运行时间长,故而并未得到广泛应用.提出了一种基于邻域关系对称性及决策值过滤策略的特征快速约简算法EasiFFRA.EasiFFRA可通过改进的散列分桶方法加速正域样本计算,可检验并过滤冗余决策值样本,从而降低现有方法中由于重复距离评估所带来的冗余计算.实验结果表明:EasiFFRA在实际采集的水质数据集和多个不同样本量及维度的公开数据集中平均加快75.45%的特征约简时间,其约简结果和已有邻域粗糙集特征约简算法等效,可有效解决物联网数据分析中由冗余及无关特征导致的分类及预测精度下降问题,有重要应用价值.",作者关键词:neighborhood rough set; feature reduction; symmetry mechanism; filtration mechanism; Hash buckets,作者关键词:邻域粗糙集; 特征约简; 对称机制; 过滤机制; 散列分桶

Efficient and Secure Cloud-Assisted Pattern Matching Protocol for Intelligent Environment,适用于智能环境的高效安全云辅助模式匹配协议,2019,"The intelligent environment built by machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of things is changing the way people live, work and think. The way of data storage and processing in intelligent environment is changing constantly, where security and efficiency are two important factors. In terms of security, privacy must be guaranteed during the sharing and analysis of data. In addition, many devices with limited resources exist in the intelligent environment, whose feasibility is directly influenced by how to design suitable algorithms or protocols. Based on the above two requirements, this paper studies the problem of secure pattern matching for intelligent environment. In the traditional secure pattern matching protocol, the pattern holder needs to compute lots of public-key operations,which is unsuitable for a resource-limited device such as a mobile phone. In this paper, we formalize the functionality of the secure pattern matching protocol under the two-cloud-assisted secure two-party computation model for the first time, and construct an efficient protocol via oblivious transfer(OT). The protocol is secure in semi-honest adversary model, assuming that no collusion exists between the cloud servers and the participants. The protocol requires 4 rounds, and the pattern holder performs only a small number of XOR operations, and the complex OT protocols are mainly executed between the database and the cloud servers. Furthermore, the OT extension technology can reduce the number of all OT protocols from O(nm) to O(k), where n and m are the input lengths of the two participants, and k is the number of base OT in OT extension protocol, which is much smaller than nm.","摘要:以机器学习、人工智能、物联网等技术所构建的智能环境正在改变人们的生活、工作及思维方式.智能环境下数据存储和处理的方式也在不断改变,其中安全和效率是2个重要的因素.就安全而言,在数据共享的前提下保护隐私势在必行.就效率而言,智能环境中存在诸多资源受限的设备,针对这些设备如何设计高效的算法或协议直接决定其可行性.从以上2个需求出发,研究适用于智能环境中的安全高效模式匹配问题.传统的安全模式匹配协议中模式持有方需要执行大量的公钥操作,因此不适用于手机等资源受限设备作为模式持有方的场景.首次在双云服务器辅助的安全两方计算模型下给出安全模式匹配协议的功能函数,并基于茫然传输(oblivious transfer, OT)给出协议的具体构造.假设云服务器和参与方之间不合谋,协议在半诚实敌手模型下是安全的.协议需要4轮交互,模式方仅需要执行少量的异或操作,而复杂的OT协议主要集中在数据库方和云服务器之间.此外,使用OT扩展(OT extension)技术可以将所有OT协议的数量从O(nm)降至O(k),其中n和m是数据库方和模式方的输入长度,k是OT扩展协议中基础OT的数目,其远小于nm.",作者关键词:intelligent environment; pattern matching; cloud-assisted secure two-party computation; oblivious transfer(OT) protocol; oblivious transfer(OT) extension,作者关键词:智能环境; 模式匹配; 云辅助安全两方计算; OT协议; OT扩展

Ciphertext-Only Fault Analysis of the MIBS Lightweight Cryptosystem in the Internet of Things,物联网中MIBS轻量级密码的唯密文故障分析,2019,"The lightweight cryptosystem MIBS was proposed at the CANS conference in 2009. It has high efficiency in both hardware implementation and software implementation. MIBS can resist against classical cryptanalysis, such as differential analysis and linear analysis, etc. It is suitable for the resource-limited devices in the Internet of things. This paper proposes new ciphertext-only fault analysis of the MIBS cryptosystem. The attackers can apply a new fault model of Double AND and two novel distinguishers of Parzen-HW and Parzen-HW-MLE to break MIBS.

Singularity Approaching and the Challenge of Smart City to Modernism Urban Planning,奇点临近与智慧城市对现代主义规划的挑战,2019,"Is the future coming? However, most visions of future cities are too vague, radical, comprehensive or conservative with confusing aims. Experience of the industrial revolution demonstrates that transformation of urban space and form is based on the interactions among technological development, social change and spatial evolution and urban space and form are renewed to cope with technological breakthroughs and social changes. Since the 1960s, the critical theory against modernist urban planning has become mature. However, due to the lack of technical weapons to change the modernist paradigm, working and living functions were still spatially separated based on commuting arrangement, and technology and lifestyle remained static. Therefore, by advocating a return to the traditional urban ideal, planning has been conservative. With the implementation of intelligent technologies such as internet of things, internet, sensors and driverless cars, new working and life styles have stimulated new demands for urban space. Humanized spatial organizations are supported by new technologies, and technological conditions for transforming modernist urban planning are favorable. Smart city movement aims to reform modern urban planning and shape the future city by applying new technology and introducing new working life style. This paper tries to put forward a triad structure of cyber-physical-social(CPS) for city building and four main characteristics of breaking the modernist urban planning paradigm.","摘要:未来已来?但未来城市的愿景描绘大多过于空泛、激进、全面或保守,特征不明,令人困惑。以往工业革命所提供的经验证明,城市空间形态的演化以技术发展、社会变革和空间演化三者的相互关系为基础。技术出现突破,社会发生变革,城市空间形态形成新的演化予以应对。1960年代以来,对现代主义城市规划批判的理论准备早已成熟,但是由于缺少变革现代主义城市规划的技术武器,同时,生产生活方式依然处在通勤上班、工作居住功能分离的模式下,技术和生活方式处在进步的停滞期,因而规划对策以向传统城市理想回归为主张,偏向保守。当前,技术和社会发展处在奇点临近的背景下,随着物联网、互联网、传感器和无人驾驶等智慧技术的应用,新的工作生活方式对空间形成新的需求,人性化的空间组织得到新技术的支撑,变革现代主义城市规划的技术条件逐步具备。智慧城市的内涵应该是基于新技术和新工作生活方式,塑造对现代主义城市规划破旧立新的未来城市。基于此,尝试提出智慧城市三元维度融合的社区化结构及其突破现代主义城市规划的四个主要要素特征。",作者关键词:future city; smart city; modernism urban planning; cyber-physical-social dimension; singularity,作者关键词:未来城市; 智慧城市; 现代主义城市规划; 三元维度; 奇点

Autonomous Cognition and Development System of Robot Service Based on a Composite Framework Combining IHDR Algorithm with BP Neural Network,基于IHDR算法和BP神经网络复合框架的机器人服务自主认知和发育系统,2019,"In order to solve the poor intelligence and universality problems of the home service robot with traditional knowledge-based or learning-based service cognitive mechanisms, an autonomous cognition and development system of robot service tasks based on a composite framework combining incremental hierarchical discriminant regression (IHDR) algorithm with BP (backpropagation) neural network is constructed. A large amount of sample data are collected for learning and development of robots based on the technical support provided by multiple sensors in intelligent space and Internet of Things (IoT). On this basis, a modified IHDR algorithm is designed in light of the mixing characteristics of these sample data to achieve cluster updating and response calculation for mixed-type sample data, and an IHDR tree is constructed as the brain of robot to store its historical experience, which will provide historical experience for robot to learn and judge, realizing autonomous cognition of services. The JSHOP2 (Java simple hierarchical planner) is used to decompose the cognized complex tasks to obtain atomic tasks which can be directly executed by the robot. Meanwhile, a service cognition algorithm based on BP neural network is developed to avoid the limitation of IHDR tree size. The BP neural network is trained with sample data to map the actual scene in intelligent space to the service required by user, and thus the robot can still make service decisions autonomously based on BP neural network in case that the IHDR tree cant provide historical experience. Next, the IHDR tree is updated incrementally with the mapping result, enriching the robots experience and knowledge, and realizing the development of autonomous cognitive ability for robot service.

A bipolar electret-based micro-vibration-driven energy harvester with multi-air-gap structure,,2019,"Micro mechanical energy harvester as a kind of micro power source for micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) has been paid considerable attention. Electret-based vibration energy harvester (E-MVEH) has been a research highlight due to its high sensitivity, simplicity and compatibility to the fabrication process of MEMS. In this manuscript, a novel E-MVEH with multiple-air-gap structure based on bipolar electrets is comparatively investigated. The E-MVEH with single-air-gap structure consists of an electret membrane (EM) with an electrode on one surface and a counter-electrode supported by means of micro-springs. The E-MVEH with double air gaps is made of a bipolar electret membrane put in the middle of two counter-electrodes that are supported by means of micro-springs. It is essentially equivalent to two variable capacitors in series. The E-MVEH with four air gaps consists of two double-air-gaps E-MVEH in parallel connection. When an external vibration causes a relative displacement between the electret membrane (EM) and the counter-electrode, the capacitance varies, leading to re-organization of the charges on the counter-electrode. Thus, an alternating current is generated and the vibration energy is converted into electric energy. This alternating current can be changed into direct current through a full bridge rectifier.",,作者关键词:self-driven power supply; micro-vibration energy harvester; electrets; multiple variable capacitor structure,

Applied technologies and new advances of parallel electrical method in mining geophysics,矿井并行电法技术体系与新进展,2019,"Parallel Electrical Method (PEM) is a kind of geoelectric field exploration method,which integrates the synchronous acquisition and processing of whole array,all electrodes,all waveforms and three kinds of electric fields.It takes the parallel measurement and parallel processing of geoelectric field in both space and time domain as its core idea based on the integration of an ADC and a switch device for each electrode,the parallel excitation and acquisition of all electrodes are realized,and the geoelectric data volume is obtained containing AM mode and ABM mode.According to the space combination and time series of electrodes,the excitation current sequence and potential response sequence of natural electric field (zero field),excitation electric field (primary field) and induction electric field (secondary field) are decomposed,and thus the resistance properties (including self-potential,resistivity and polarizability etc.) of the detecting medium are analyzed according to the transmission principle of potential response and current excitation,therefore,the parallel analysis of three kinds of electric field information is realized using this method.The Mine-PEM makes full use of roadway space,borehole space and its combination form in coal mine,thus it can effectively explore water-filled source,water-bearing fault,karst collapse column and grouting effect in both roof and floor,dynamically detect mining rock damage characteristics and water-rich anomaly area,real-timely monitor groundwater seepage evolution and predict mine water disasters.In the past 15 years,these techniques have been widely applied and promoted in coal mme water disaster prevention all over China,as a result of which the technology system of Mine-PEM has been established.The intelligent characteristics of Network Parallel Electrical Method show its advantages thanks to the popularization of Internet of Things technology in coal mines in China,which realizes the online remote control of timing excitation and acquisition as well as real-time dynamic monitoring of mine geoelectric field.Furthermore,the Double-mode Electrode Testing Technique overcomes the shortcomings of using the same electrode for both excitation and acquisition in normal geoelectric measuring techniques,such as multi-electrode resistivity method (high-density electrical method),which always results in errors or even failures with natural electric field and induced electric field data,and this technique ensures the data validity of PEM.Therefore,the PEM effectively integrates active source exploration and passive source monitoring,which makes a significant contribution to the dynamic and fine detection of mine disaster sources,especially to mine water hazards early-warning,and presently two Chinese energy industry standards closely related to PEM has been implemented.Additionally,PEM not only provides a technical support for intelligent mines and transparent mines construction in China,but also has been widely used in engineering geophysics,environmental geophysics and urban underground space exploration areas.At present,the parallel analysis and joint inversion of multi-parameters of geoelectric field is the key research area of PEM,and by studying the electric impedance tomography theory based on PEM,effective means should be formed to explore multi-field coupling and evolution characteristics in multi-phase media.","摘要:并行电法(Parallel Electrical Method,PEM)是集阵列式、全电极、全波形3种电场(自然电场、激励电场和感应电场)的同步采集和处理于一体的地电场勘探方法,它以时空域地电场的并行测试与并行处理为核心思想:通过每个电极1个ADC及开关装置的集成,实现全部电极的并行激励与采集,获得包括AM法和ABM法两种形式的地电场数据体;按照电极的空间组合与时序关系,解编出激励电流序列和对应的自然电场(零次场)、激励电场(一次场)和感应电场(二次场)的电位响应序列,再根据电位响应与电流激励的传递原理解析出探测介质的电阻抗属性(包括自然电位、电阻率和极化率等参数),由此实现3种电场信息的并行解析。矿井并行电法(Mine-PEM)充分利用了巷道空间、钻孔空间及其组合形式,进而实现了对煤层顶底板充水水源、导(含)水断层、岩溶陷落柱及注浆改造效果的有效探查,对采动围岩破坏特征及富水异常区的动态检测,以及对地下水渗流演化的实时远程监测及水害超前预警等,这些技术于过去15 a间在全国煤矿防治水领域得到推广应用,发展、形成了矿井并行电法技术体系。矿井物联网技术的普及,使网络并行电法的智能特色得以发挥,实现了矿井地电场定时激励采集与实时动态监测的在线远程控制;双模式电极测试技术(Double-mode Electrode Testing Technique)的引入与应用,解决了常规地电场测试技术(如高密度电法)中激发、接收共用同一电极而导致自然电场、感应电场数据误差大甚或失效的问题,保证了3种电场并行测试数据的有效性;由此,并行电法技术实现了对主动源电法勘探与被动源地电场监测的有效融合,这对矿井灾害源动态、精细探测尤其是水害预警来说意义重大,形成的并行电法国家能源行业标准已得到实施。并行电法不仅可为智能矿山、透明矿山的建设提供技术保障,而且在工程与环境物探领域以及城市地下空间精细探查中也已得到推广。当前,地电场多参数的并行解析与联合反演是其重点研究内容,通过对介质电阻抗成像理论的深入研究,有望为岩土体多相介质多场耦合作用及其演化特征的探查提供有效手段。",作者关键词:parallel electric method (PEM); mining geophysics; rock damage; groundwater seepage; mine water prevention and control,作者关键词:并行电法; 矿井物探; 岩体破坏; 地下水渗流; 煤矿防治水

Agricultural internet of things data reconstruction based on K-nearest neighbor reconstruction algorithm improved by regularization penalty and spatio-temporal constraints,基于正则化与时空约束改进K最近邻算法的农业物联网数据重构,2019,"The internet of things (IoT) technology has been widely applied in the agriculture production monitoring. Accurate decision-making and environment regulation can be made based on monitoring results. However, data loss in agriculture wireless sensor networks is common due to noise, collision, unreliable link, and unexpected damage, which greatly reduces the quality of data acquisition and then affects the results of decision analysis. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a data reconstruction method based on K nearest neighbor with regularization penalty constraints (KNN-RP). Firstly, the ridge regression method was used in order to regularize the least square factor. Secondly, there was a problem that it is difficult to get a unique solution due to the algorithmic error while the data matrix is not full-column rank. This could be improved by introducing a penalty term into the method. The combination of 1-norm and 2-norm could ensure the sparsity of the matrix as well as prevent the loss function from over-fitting. It is suitable for high-dimensional agricultural WSN (wireless sensor network) data reconstruction with high noise. Furthermore, the definition of time and space constraint matrix was determined according to the temporal and spatial stability of perceptual data in agricultural IoT. Finally, the K value was determined by model training to achieve the better reconstruction performance. A cross-validate experiment was done to evaluate the algorithm performance according to the greenhouse data samples. KNN (K nearest neighbor), KNN-inverse and DT (delaunay triangulation) algorithms were chosen for the performance comparison. In the element random loss case, the overall reconstruction error rate of the 4 algorithms increased with the increasing of data loss rate. The KNN and KNN-inverse had higher error rate when the data loss rate above 60% compared with the other 2 algorithms. Besides, the performance of KNN-RP was superior to the DT algorithm in both high and low data loss rates. In the block loss case, the reconstruction error rates of the 4 algorithms were close to the element random loss case, but reconstruction error rates increased faster than the element random loss case while the data loss rate increased. In the block loss case, the overall performance of KNN-RP was better than KNN and KNN-inverse, but lower than that of DT algorithm when the data loss rate was above 60%. The K value had a significant influence on the performance of KNN-RP. The reconstruction error of KNN-RP decreased first and then increased with the increasing of K value. For the stable parameter like temperature, the reconstruction error rate was less affected by K value. On the contrast, the reconstruction error rates of humidity and lightness data were more affected by K value. The reason maybe the humidity and lightness data changed faster than temperature. Considering all 3 parameters, temperature, humidity and lightness, the optimal K value was between 6 and 8. In summary, KNN-RP algorithm could effectively reconstruct the missing errors in the agricultural IoT, especially in element random loss case. The proposed algorithm improves the quality of perceptual data in agricultural IoT monitoring and may provide reference for agricultural production decision-making.","摘要:针对农业复杂环境易发的物联网感知数据丢失异常问题,该文提出一种基于正则化惩罚的K最近邻数据重构方法(K nearest neighbor-regularization penalty,KNN-RP),采用岭回归方法对最近邻方法中的最小二乘因子进行正则化,并讨论了惩罚项的范数选取形式。通过对农业物联网感知数据的时空稳定性与相关性分析,确定了时间与空间约束矩阵的定义方式。采用温室数据样本对算法性能进行交叉验证,结果显示该文的KNN-RP性能在点丢失模型下优于KNN、反距离加权KNN算法以及DT算法,而在块丢失模型下优于KNN和反距离加权KNN算法,略低于DT算法,提高了农业物联网的感知数据质量。该研究可为基于物联网数据的农业生产决策提供参考。",作者关键词:algorithms; models; agricultural internet of things; data reconfiguration; cluster regression,作者关键词:算法; 模型; 农业物联网; 数据重构; 聚类回归

Lightweight Format-Preserving Encryption Algorithm Oriented to Number,面向数字型的轻量级保形加密算法研究,2019,"The Internet of things (IoT), which has been widespread and large-scale applied, arises more and more security and privacy issues. Lightweight encryption is an important measurement for ensuring confidentiality for devices of IoT, in where the computing, storage and energy resources are always limited. However, the shallow application of lightweight block cipher will change the format of ciphertext tremendously due to confusion and diffusion operations. These changes make the ciphertext inconsistent with plaintext in expressive form and format, and lead to require extra storage, computation and redisplay resources. Lightweight format-preserving encryption algorithm can ensure data confidentiality while maintaining the format consistency between ciphertext and plaintext, and these features benefit to IoT greatly. Aiming at the problems that the traditional format-preserving encryption algorithm performs inefficiently, consumes many resources, and cannot encrypt length numeric data, a lightweight format-preserving encryption algorithm oriented to number is proposed in this work. Firstly, a numeric typed permutation table is constructed by using lightweight block cipher algorithm; then the numerical plaintext is added to the key of lightweight block cipher in one-to-one correspondence, and the modulo 10 operation is performed; at last, replacement cryptographic operation is performed to obtain the numerical ciphertext by using the proposed the numeric typed replacement table. The proposed algorithm preserves the format for any numerical data with arbitrary length, and it's also consistent with the original lightweight block cipher in terms of efficiency and security. By comparing with traditional format-preserving encryption, the experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm is more security, more efficient and more lowly lower resource-consuming. It is suitable for secure storage and data marking of numerical data in resource-constrained environment devices of IoT.","摘要:物联网的大规模普及应用引发了诸多安全和隐私问题.轻量级加密是资源受限环境下物联网设备保证数据机密性的主要手段,然而直接应用轻量级分组密码加密会因为编码序列的混淆扩散使密文格式发生巨大变化,在表现形式和格式上与明文不一致,需要额外的存储、计算、回显资源.轻量级保形加密算法可以在实现机密性的同时,保持密文数据与明文数据在格式上具有一致性,在物联网领域具有更大的优势.针对现有保形加密算法存在实现效率不高、资源消耗较大及不能加密较长数字型数据的问题,提出一种面向数字型的轻量级保形加密算法.首先利用轻量级分组密码算法构造数字型置换表,数字型明文与轻量级分组密码的加密密钥进行一一对应相加、取模10操作,再利用数字型置换表进行置换加密操作,得到数字型密文数据.算法实现了对任何长度数字型数据加密前后的格式不改变,分析表明该算法在效率、安全性方面与原轻量级分组密码算法保持一致.同时,实验结果表明:相比传统的保形加密算法,该算法具有高安全、高效、低资源,适用于资源受限环境下物联网设备的数据加密存储及数据遮蔽.",作者关键词:lightweight block cipher; format-preserving encryption; numeric data; Internet of things (IoT); data marking,作者关键词:轻量级分组密码; 保形加密; 数字型数据; 物联网; 数据遮蔽
Chinese Text Extraction Method of Natural Scene Images Based on City Monitoring,基于城市监控的自然场景图像的中文文本提取方法,2019,"Efficient environment monitoring and information analysis in urban scenes has become one of primary tasks of smart cities. In smart cities, the recognition of text information in scene images, especially the extraction of Chinese text in scene images, is an intuitive and efficient method for analyzing scene information. However, the Chinese text extraction of the current scene images fails to achieve good results because of the uneven illumination and blurred images. In addition, the complexity of Chinese character structure is also an important factor affecting the Chinese text extraction. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an edge enhanced maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) detection method, which can extract the MSER under the conditions of illumination and blurring influence, and the non-MSER can be efficiently filtered by geometric feature constraints to obtain high quality candidate MSER. Then the proposed central aggregation is used to aggregate the candidate Chinese text field that has been divided into multiple MSER, so that the candidate region becomes a single candidate Chinese text component, and then these components are analyzed, and finally the correct Chinese text is selected by machine learning.

Design of monitoring system of ill-dead pig harmless treatment based on internet of things in mountainous area,基于物联网的病死猪无害化处理山区运输监控系统设计,2019,"Currently, most harmless disposal refrigerated vehicles use the global positioning system (GPS) to determine the position of disinfection stations and the transport routes of pigs died of diseases. However, the single navigation and positioning information might be unstable when the vehicle was running in remote mountainous area, the information transfer was not continuous, incomplete and untrue. In order to solve this issue, a monitoring system was designed based on radio frequency identification technology (RFID), Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) and global positioning system (GPS). This paper makes full use of the BDS/GPS dual-mode receiver, which supports positioning and two-way communication functions. On the one hand, it can solve the problem of positioning information instability that occurs when using a single positioning. On the other hand, when the BDS navigation positioning system data appeared to show a deviation, The GPS positioning data from the WGS-84 coordinate system was converted to the CGCS2000 coordinate system of the BDS positioning system, to achieve the purpose of improving the acquisition accuracy of the transport vehicles location information. GAMIT software was used to calculate the 3D coordinates of the observation point, and it was analyzed for the positioning accuracy of combined navigation and single navigation. Floyd algorithm was combined to optimize transportation routes to search for the shortest transportation distance. The harmless transportation vehicles walking map could be drawn from the positioning information of the BDS/GPS dual-mode receiver. The message communication function of BDS satellite was used instead of GSM short message service to realize remote transmission between harmless transportation vehicles and control center. When pigs died of diseases are transported to fixed-point disinfection station, RFID reader will read the vehicle-mounted RFID active electronic tags to recognize the transport vehicles and the GPRS network will transmit the fixed-point disinfection monitoring data to the monitoring center. Monitoring center uses the ArcGIS map display to carry out the real-time monitoring of vehicle transport routes, and uses text to speech to realize the intelligent deployment and management of transport vehicles. Meanwhile, monitoring center obtains the transport routes of pigs died of diseases and the fixed-point disinfection monitoring information by analyzing the received data. After field test, the positioning accuracy of BDS/GPS dual mode receiver was 55.13% higher than that of BDS satellite positioning, and 52.71% higher than that of GPS satellite positioning. The networks packet losses value of vehicle terminal acquisition system was 0.26%, and the error rate of vehicle identification of the disinfection point was 0.97%. The results showed that the monitoring system met the requirements of the monitoring and management system in mountainous areas, and it ran reliable and stable. The study provides an effective method for a transport vehicle for the harmless treatment of dead pigs, accomplishes the comprehensive supervision and management of transport vehicles for the harmless treatment of dead pigs. This system can also be adopted as a reference to harmless disposal systems for other pigs that die of diseases, it has practical value.","摘要:目前,大多数无害化处置运输车辆使用全球定位系统(global positioning system,GPS)来确定病死猪的消毒站位置和运输路线。然而,当车辆在偏远山区运行时,定位信息传递不连续和不完整。为了解决这个问题,设计了一套病死猪无害化处理监控系统,系统结合北斗导航系统、全球定位系统、无线射频识别技术(radio frequency identification, RFID)、通用分组无线服务技术和地理信息系统等技术。利用北斗/GPS双模用户机双模定位和双向通信的功能,一方面,它可以解决单一定位时出现的定位信息不稳定的问题;另一方面,当BDS导航定位系统数据似乎显示出偏差,将WGS-84坐标系的GPS定位数据转换为BDS定位系统的CGCS2000坐标系,以提高运输车辆位置信息采集精度的目的。利用GAMIT软件计算观测点的三维坐标,并对组合导航和单导航的定位精度进行分析。采用Floyd算法对运输路线进行优化,寻找最短的运输距离。利用北斗卫星的信息通信功能代替全球移动通信系统(global system for mobile communications, GSM),短消息业务,实现无害化运输车辆与控制中心之间的信息远程传输。控制中心通过对接收到的数据进行分析,得到病死猪收运车的运输路线和定点消毒监测信息。系统试验表明:采集的数据能够准确及时地传输到控制中心,北斗/GPS双模接收机定位精度比北斗卫星定位精度高55.13%,比GPS卫星定位精度高52.71%。北斗通信的网络丢包率为0.26%,消毒点的车辆定点识别误差率0.97%,结果表明,满足病死猪无害化处理监控管理的要求,系统运行可靠、稳定。该系统的构建与应用,为其他病死动物无害化处理的综合管理与监控提供参考。",作者关键词:monitoring; design; internet of things; harmless treatment; Beidou satellite; Floyd algorithm; transport route map,作者关键词:监控; 设计; 物联网; 无害化处理; 北斗卫星; Floyd算法; 运输线路图

HBcipher: An Efficient Lightweight Block Cipher,HBcipher: 一种高效的轻量级分组密码,2019,"With the popularity of IoT applications, it has a great significance to design efficient and lightweight block ciphers to ensure the information security for the resource-constrained devices. This study designs a high-efficiency lightweight block cipher named HBcipher. Its block length is 64 bits and it supports key lengths of 64 bits and 128 bits. The round function of HBcipher adopts three sets of F-functions of SPN structure, and constructs a new P2 permutation by using geometric mapping properties when designing the F-function, which effectively hides the statistical characteristics of plaintext and improves the ability of anti-statistical analysis. In order to avoid completely exposing the last round to the attacker, a whitening key module is added after the last round of P2 permutation output. Meanwhile, a dynamic AddRoundKey operation is designed. The encrypted data dynamically selects the updated subkey according to the parity of the algorithm's control signal.

The experimental results show that the HBcipher algorithm has nice avalanche effect and randomization characteristics, and its software implementation performance is superior to the PRESENT which is optimized for hardware implementation.

Redundant RFID Data Filtering Algorithm Research Based on Bloom Filter,基于布隆过滤器的RFID 数据冗余处理算法研究,2019,"As a key technology in the field of Internet of Things, RFID technology has broad application prospects. However, RFID devices generate a large amount of redundant data when reading tag information. Therefore , the research on RFID data redundancy processing is of great significance for reducing the load of RFID middleware system and quickly detecting incoming and outgoing tags. Previous studies on the redundancy filtering of RFID data are often simple filtering of single-dimensional and static scenes, and it is impossible to detect the ingress and egress of tags in complex scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm called Time Distance Bloom Filter (TDBF), which performs redundant filtering from both time and space. Compared with the Time Bloom filter, this algorithm takes into account the reading time and reading distance of the RFID tags, which greatly reduces the redundancy of the data. In the case of ensuring a low miss rate, the false-positive rate of the data is greatly reduced.

A Survey on IPv6 Address Structure Standardization Researches,IPv6地址结构标准化研究综述,2019,"With the commercialization and wide deployment of IPv6 network,IPv6 related research is becoming a new research hotspot. Compared with IPv4, IPv6 address has 128 bits; its generation, application and security are much more complicated. The understanding of IPv6 address structure is of great value in researches like IPv6 address planning, network measurement, network security and next generation Internet architecture. There are a number of RFC standards related to IPv6 address structure; these standards cover a wide range of topics, which makes it difficult to understand the IPv6 address structure comprehensively. This paper summarizes current IPv6 address structure related standards, including IPv6 global unicast address structure, IPv6 multicast address structure, IPv6 anycast address structure. Based on the brief introduction of various address structures, several significant differences between IPv4 and IPv6 address structures are introduced. Firstly, IPv6 addresses can be divided into two parts: subnet prefix and interface identifier. Compared with IPv4,IPv6 interface identifier has its own generation method, and IPv6 interface identifier generation scheme is close related to IPv6 address security and privacy. Secondly, IPv6 and IPv4 will coexist for a long time; therefore transition technology is widely-deployed. IPv6 address in transition technology is often different from that in normal situation. Finally, multihoming is more common in IPv6 networks,which results in the difficulty in address selection. To deal with this problem, one approach is to establish source address selection policy and destination address selection policy. Another solution is locator/identifier separation related schemes. With the further deployment of IPv6,IPv6 address structure in the Internet of Things, and IPv6 address security have absorbed growing research interest. The widespread application of the Internet of Things has accelerated the deployment of IPv6. However, due to the limitation of the Internet of Things itself, such as the smaller MTU and limited energy capacity, generation scheme usually needs to ensure that the generated interface identifier is easy to compress. Another research topic is IPv6 address security. Unlike IPv4,IPv6 lacks security experience in large-scale application. Moreover, a large number of devices only support IPv6 in a basic manner, but IPv6 has more complicated application scenarios than IPv4. The IPv6 security situation has worsened for the above reasons; this article provides a brief introduction on these aspects.","摘要:随着IPv6网络商用化的进行和大面积部署,IPv6相关的研究正在成为新的研究热点.相对于IPv4而言,IPv6地址有128比特,因此其生成、使用、安全等方面的情况也要比IPv4复杂得多,而对IPv6地址结构的深入了解,是进行IPv6地址规划、IPv6网络测量、IPv6网络安全以及下一代互联网网络体系结构等方面研究的基础.涉及IPv6地址结构方面的互联网标准数量众多、内容涵盖面广,这些都不利于全面了解IPv6地址结构.本文总结了目前IPv6地址结构相关的标准,包括IPv6全球单播地址结构、IPv6组播地址结构、IPv6任播地址结构等,在简要介绍各种地址结构的基础上,特别介绍了IPv6地址结构中几个和IPv4显著不同的地方.首先,IPv6地址通常可以分成子网前缀和接口标识两个部分,与IPv4相比IPv6增加了接口标识生成方案,而且IPv6接口标识的生成方案与IPv6安全和隐私保护紧密相关;其次,IPV6、IPV4将长期共存,因此过渡技术必不可少,而过渡技术中的地址结构与普通IPv6地址有所不同;最后,IPv6网络中多宿主机的情况更加普遍,导致了广泛存在的地址选择问题.针对这一问题,除了通过建立IPv6网络的源地址选择策略和目的地址选择策略来解决之外,定位符与身份标识分离也提供了一种解决思路.随着IPv6的进一步广泛部署,物联网中的IPv6地址结构以及IPv6地址安全方面的研究得到了越来越多的关注.物联网的广泛应用促使IPv6加速部署,但由于物联网本身的一些特点如最大报文长度较短、要求能耗较低等,物联网中IPv6的接口标识生成方案通常要保证所生成的接口标识便于压缩.另一个得到越来越多重视的研究方向是IPv6地址安全,与IPv4网络的情况有所不同,IPv6网络欠缺大规模使用的安全经验,大量支持IPv6的设备对IPv6协议的实现也只实现了基本功能,而由于IPv6较IPv4有更为复杂的应用场景,因此IPv6网络的安全问题逐渐成为一个突出的问题.本文对这些方面的研究进行了简要的介绍.",作者关键词:IPv6 address; IPv6 network management; IPv6 network security,作者关键词:IPv6地址; IPv6网络管理; IPv6网络安全

Attribute-Based Encryption for Data Security Sharing of Internet of Things,面向物联网数据安全共享的属性基加密方案,2019,"The development of Internet of things (IoT) has always been faced with serious security threats and challenges. The security sharing and fine-grained access control of data in the IoT is one of the security issues that urgently need to deal with. In order to solve this problem, an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme with the hidden access structure for data security sharing of IoT is proposed. This scheme can achieve fine-grained access control of ciphertext and guarantee data privacy. In this paper, a universal method to convert identity-based encryption (IBE) into ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is proposed, which supports AND-gate access structure with multiple values. The converted CP-ABE can inherit the characteristics of IBE. Then, the receiver anonymous IBE scheme proposed by Wee is converted to the CP-ABE scheme with the hidden access structure based on the conversion method, which realizes the fixed length of ciphertext, user secret key, public key and master secret key, and only needs one bilinear pairing computation in the decryption phase. The converted scheme is applied to the intelligent medical application scene and the system model and application steps are given. Finally, the results of theoretical analysis and experimental simulation show that the proposed scheme implements the hidden access structure and has advantages in computing efficiency, storage burden and security. It is more efficient and secure when the scheme is applied to the IoT environment.","摘要:物联网的发展一直面临着严峻的安全威胁和挑战,而物联网数据的安全共享及细粒度访问控制是其急需应对的安全问题之一.针对该问题,提出一种面向物联网数据安全共享的访问结构隐藏的属性基加密方案.该方案在保证数据隐私的情况下,能够实现密文数据的细粒度访问控制.首先提出一种将身份加密方案(identity-based encryption, IBE)转换为支持多值属性与门的密文策略属性基加密方案(ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, CP-ABE)的通用转换方法,并且转换后的CP-ABE能够继承IBE的特征.然后基于该转换方法将Wee提出的接收者匿名IBE方案转换为访问结构隐藏的CP-ABE方案,实现了密文、用户私钥、公钥和主私钥长度恒定,且解密只需一个双线对运算.而后将该CP-ABE方案应用于物联网中的智慧医疗应用场景,并给出应用的系统模型及步骤.最后,理论分析与实验结果表明所提方案在实现访问结构隐藏时,在计算效率、存储负担及安全性方面具有优势,在实际应用于物联网环境时更加高效和安全.",作者关键词:Internet of things (IoT); privacy protection; data sharing; ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE); hidden access structure,作者关键词:物联网; 隐私保护; 数据共享; 密文策略属性基加密; 隐藏访问结构

An ecological Internet of Things for islands : Concept and model,海岛生态物联网建设:概念和模型,2019,"Islands are important part of natural resources. However, their spatially-confined nature, due to a strong effect of the sea, makes them ecologically more vulnerable, thus calling for the strengthening of protection strategies. Such strategies must take the specific ecological background of the island landform into account,as well as consider other information,such as future development and trends. Monitoring through an Island Ecological Internet of Things (IEIOT) approach can provide an important support to protection strategies. In this paper, the concept of IEIOT is firstly summarised on the basis of previous studies. Then, using the Internet of Things (IOT) technology, an automatic, real-time and long-term monitoring of an island ecosystem is carried out. Information on biological,abiotic and ecological security of the island is obtained through the monitoring to get insight into the changing patterns and mechanisms of the island ecosystem in response to natural and human activities. The basic network system for assessing the state of the island ecology is presented, which is fundamental to make appropriate decisions and carry out island ecology research. A concept model of the IEIOT is constructed,tailored to the peculiar characteristics of the island. The IEIOT monitoring system is composed of a monitoring layer of ecological elements,a data acquisition layer,a storage layer,a network transmission layer,an energy security layer,a security layer, and an application layer. The IEIOT is different from other IOT systems in several aspects including its construction, monitoring content, data management, maintenance, and data application. Finally, a typical island of Guangdong, Triangle Island,is taken as a case study to demonstrate the construction and application of the conceptual model of IEIOT. The case study provides a reference for the possible future implementation and management of an IEIOT system in Triangle Island. Furthermore, the work provides a theoretical and practical reference for the ecological monitoring of islands, and for the construction of IEIOT systems.","摘要:海岛是自然资源的重要组成部分,但由于受海洋影响强烈、海岛空间有限而生态脆弱性明显,应加强保护。保护的前提则需要掌握海岛生态本底现状及未来发展、变化趋势等信息,海岛生态物联网监测则能够为实现这一需求提供重要支撑。本文在前人相关研究的基础上,概述了海岛生态物联网的概念,即基于物联网技术对海岛生态系统开展自动、实时、长期监测并获取海岛生物、非生物、生态安全等信息以掌握海岛生态系统在自然和人为活动干扰下的变化规律与机制,评估海岛生态状况以作出相应决策和开展海岛生态学研究的基础网络体系;结合海岛特点构建了海岛生态物联网概念模型,形成了由生态要素监测层、数据采集层、存储层、网络传输层、能源保障层、保密层、应用层等7部分构成的监测体系;海岛生态物联网在前期构建、监测内容、数据管理、建设及维护、数据应用等方面具有区别于其他物联网的特征。以广东典型小海岛三角岛为例展示了海岛生态物联网概念模型在具体海岛上的构建应用,为下一步开展三角岛生态物联网的实践应用及管理提供基础参考,为海岛生态监测和生态物联网建设提供理论和实践参考,并有助于未来海岛生态物联网建设的研究。",作者关键词:island; island ecological internet of things; ecological monitoring; conceptual mode of ecological monitoring,作者关键词:海岛; 海岛生态物联网; 生态监测; 概念模型

Secure Routing Mechanism Based on Trust Against Packet Dropping Attack in Internet of Things,物联网中基于信任抗丢包攻击的安全路由机制,2019,"In an open Internet of Things environment,nodes are vulnerable to malicious packet dropping attacks (including black hole attacks and gray hole attacks) in the routing process,which will seriously affect the connectivity of the network and lead to the decrease of packet delivery rate and the increase of end-to-end delay.For this reason,this paper proposed a trust-based secure routing mechanism on the basis of RPL protocol.According to the behavior of the nodes in the data forwarding process,the penalty factor is introduced to evaluate the direct trust relationship between the nodes,the entropy is used to assign weights to the direct trust value and the indirect trust value,so that the comprehensive trust value of the evaluated nodes is obtained.The fuzzy set theory is used to classify the trust relationship between nodes,and the neighbor nodes with higher trust level are selected for the routing node to forward data,while the neighbor nodes with lower trust level are isolated from the network.In addition,in order to prevent normal nodes from being isolated from the network as malicious nodes due to some non-intrusion factors,a given recovery time will be provided to further determine whether to isolate them from the network.This paper used Contiki operating system and its Cooja network simulator to carry out the simulation experiment of this scheme.The results show that the malicious node detection rate,false detection rate,packet delivery rate and end-to-end delay of this scheme are improved when the number of nodes and the proportion of malicious nodes are different.In terms of security,the malicious node detection rate and false detection rate of this scheme are significantly better than tRPL protocol.In terms of routing performance,the packetdelivery rate and end-to-end delay of this scheme are significantly better than tRPL protocol and MRHOF-RPL protocol.The simulation analysis results fully demonstrate that this scheme can not only effectively identify malicious nodes,but also maintain better routing performance in the presence of malicious attacks.","摘要:在开放的物联网环境下,节点在路由过程中极易遭到恶意丢包攻击(包括黑洞攻击和灰洞攻击),这将严重影响网络的连通性,并导致网络的数据包投递率下降以及端到端延时增加。为此,在RPL协议的基础上,提出了一种基于信任的安全路由机制。根据节点在数据转发过程中的行为表现,引入惩罚因子来评估节点间的直接信任关系,通过熵为直接信任值和间接信任值分配权重,进而得到被评估节点的综合信任值。利用模糊集合理论对节点间的信任关系进行等级划分,为路由节点选取信任等级较高的邻居节点进行数据转发,而信任等级较低的邻居节点将被隔离出网络。此外,为了避免正常节点由于某些非入侵因素而被当作恶意节点隔离出网络,为这类节点提供一个给定的恢复时间,从而进一步判断是否将其隔离出网络。利用Contiki操作系统及其自带的Cooja网络模拟器对所提方案进行仿真,实验结果表明,在节点数目和恶意节点比例不同时,本方案的恶意节点检测率、误检率、数据包投递率和端到端延时4个指标均有所改善。在安全性方面,本方案的恶意节点检测率和误检率明显优于tRPL协议;在路由性能方面,本方案的数据包投递率和端到端延时明显优于tRPL协议和MRHOF-RPL协议。仿真分析结果充分说明:所提方案不仅能够有效识别恶意节点,而且能够在恶意攻击存在的情况下保持较好的路由性能。",作者关键词:Internet of things; Trust evaluation; Packet dropping attack; Malicious detection; RPL protocol,作者关键词:物联网; 信任评估; 丢包攻击; 恶意检测; RPL协议
MTOA positioning method of coalmine based on Kalman filter and parameter fitting,基于改进卡尔曼滤波和参数拟合的矿井TOA 定位方法,2019,"The problem that the positioning accuracy of time of arrival (TOA) positioning method is susceptible to the delay of the non line of sight (NLOS) in propagation makes it difficult to meet the requirements of underground emergency rescue,personnel operation management and mine IoT (Internet of things) construction,etc. Based on the analysis of the reference model and the characteristics of the mine roadway equipment,the NLOS propagation delay of the roadway electromagnetic wave is divided into random NLOS delay and fixed NLOS delay. Combined with the characteristics of two kinds of NLOS delays,a method of mine TOA positioning based on improved Kalman filter and parameter fitting is proposed. In order to eliminate the random NLOS delay error in roadway caused by mobile equipment,such as locomotives in mine roadway,and irregular equipment and features by randomness and difficulty in quantitative analysis,a new threshold is designed and introduced into the Kalman filter to improve the system's ability in filtering the pulse error. Meanwhile,in order to suppress the stable NLOS delay error caused by the fixed facilities and equipment in the mine roadway,the roadway range finding error model is proposed,in which the functional relationship between the inherent equipment parameters and the positioning estimated value is established. Thus,the positioning accuracy of the system can be improved by using the parameter fitting and projection geometry algorithm. The simulation results show that after the measurement data is processed by the Kalman filter based on the threshold of innovation,the error curve tends to be smoother,and the positioning error is kept between 1. 9 and 3. 1 m. After being processed by the parameter fitting and geometric algorithm,the positioning error is between 0 and 0. 8 m,and the average error is reduced from 2. 4 m to 0. 3 m. Compared with the other three methods,including the symmetric double-sided two-way ranging (SDS-TWR) method,the Kalman filter and fingerprint localization method,and the Kalman filter and parameter simulation, the average positioning error of the proposed method is reduced by 3. 4 m,0. 4 m and 0. 6 m respectively. It shows that the proposed method has a significant inhibitory effect on the TOA positioning error,and can effectively implement the TOA method in the mine NLOS environment.","摘要:针对矿井TOA(Time of Arrival)定位精度易受电磁波NLOS(Non Line of Sight)传播时延的影响,且不能满足井下应急救援、人员作业管理以及矿井物联网建设等需求的问题,通过对NLOS时延参考模型和矿井巷道设备运动特点的分析,将巷道电磁波NLOS传播时延分为随机NLOS时延和固定NLOS时延,结合两类NLOS时延造成测距误差的特点,提出了基于改进卡尔曼滤波和参数拟合的矿井TOA定位方法。为了消除由矿井巷道中机车等移动设备以及不规律设置设备引起的、具有随机性和难以定量分析等特点的巷道随机NLOS时延误差,设计了将新息阈值引入卡尔曼滤波器中,提高其系统对脉冲误差的滤除能力的方法;为了抑制由矿井巷道中固定设施及设备造成的具有稳定性的巷道固定NLOS时延误差,建立了巷道测距误差模型,构建了井下固有设备参数与定位估计值间的函数关系,通过参数拟合与投影几何算法来提高系统的定位精度。仿真结果显示,测量数据经过基于新息阈值的卡尔曼滤波器处理之后,误差曲线趋于平稳,定位误差保持在1. 9 ~3. 1 m,再经参数拟合和几何算法处理后,定位误差在0 ~0. 8 m,平均误差由2. 4 m降为0. 3 m;且相比于SDSTWR(Symmetric Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging)方法、卡尔曼滤波和指纹定位方法以及卡尔曼滤波和参数拟合方法,所提方法平均定位误差分别减小了3. 4,0. 4和0. 6 m。从而表明所提方法对TOA定位误差具有较明显的抑制作用,可以实现TOA方法在矿井NLOS环境中的有效应用。",作者关键词:NLOS; TOA; coal positioning; Kalman filter; NLOS; parameter fitting; TOA; emergency rescue,作者关键词:矿井定位; 卡尔曼滤波; 参数拟合; 应急救援
RFID mutual authentication protocol based on block lattice,基于区块格的RFID双向认证协议,2019,"With the continuous development of Internet of Things technology,Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) technology has received more and more attention all over the world.However,the rapidly developing application scenarios have led to the security assumptions of traditional RFID mutual authentication protocols no longer hold. Besides,as the scale of the Internet of Things expands,the drawbacks of the traditional centralized RFID authentication architecture have gradually emerged.The blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization and Byzantine fault tolerance.Because of that,it can effectively solve the above problems at the same time,but its efficiency is unacceptable.Block lattice is a directed acyclic graph structure in the blockchain technology.It can process transactions in parallel which leads to the improvement of efficiency.However,due to the limitation of the consensus mechanism,block lattice still has a throughput bottleneck,and cannot meet the requirements of the RFID authentication system.In order to solve this problem,we first analyze the behavior of the malicious reader and propose the fork-tolerant block lattice which is suitable for this scenario.Then,we prove that the proposed block lattice still remains a partially ordered set.After that,by taking the advantages of the traditional RFID mutual protocol,we design a new RFID mutual authentication protocol based on the proposed block lattice.The throughput bottlenecks are eliminated from the proposed protocol by removing the consensus mechanism,and this paper explains that the security of the protocol is not affected despite that.Finally,we analyze the efficiency of the proposed protocol,and the results show that the protocol has the same efficiency as the centralized structure used in traditional RFID mutual authentication protocol on the premise of ensuring security.","摘要:随着物联网技术的不断发展,RFID(Radio Frequency Identification)技术越来越受到人们的重视.然而,快速发展的应用场景导致传统RFID双向认证协议的安全性假设不再成立.不仅如此,随着物联网规模的不断扩大,传统的中心化RFID认证架构的弊端也逐渐凸显出来.区块链技术具有去中心化和拜占庭容错的特点,可以同时有效地解决上述问题,但其效率十分低下.区块格是区块链技术中的一种有向无环图结构,具有并行处理交易的特点,可以提高执行效率,但因受限于共识机制,仍有吞吐量瓶颈.首先分析了恶意阅读器的可能行为,设计了适用于本场景的容忍分叉的区块格结构,并证明了其仍然具有偏序关系;然后结合传统的RFID双向认证协议,设计了基于区块格的RFID双向认证协议,所提出的协议在安全性不受影响的前提下去除了共识机制,消除了吞吐量瓶颈;最后,对所提出的协议的效率进行了分析,结果显示本协议在保证安全性的前提下具有在渐进意义上与传统协议采用的中心化架构一致的效率.",作者关键词:RFID; block lattice; RFID; mutual authentication protocol; decentralization,作者关键词:区块格; 双向认证协议; 去中心化

Development status of world cephalopod fisheries and suggestions for squid jigging fishery in China,世界头足类资源开发现状及我国远洋鱿钓渔业发展对策,2019,"The cephalopods are one of the most potential fishing species in the world and have become an important component of the worlds marine fishing industry. The world cephalopod fisheries and their composition were analysed using the grey association method based on the world cephalopod production statistics from 1970 to 2016. According to the development status of Chinas pelagic squid fishery,the problems are pointed out and the development countermeasures are put forward. The analysis found that the worlds cephalopod fishing production in the period from 1970 to 2016 generally showed a relatively stable growth trend,with an annual growth rate of 3. 68%,which is much higher than the growth rate of world marine fishing production in the same period,and reached its highest level ever in 2014. Between 2010 and 2016,the proportion of cephalopods in world fishing production stabilized between 4. 5% and 6. 0%. The composition and proportion of the production for different families have varied from one generation to another, and the production of main countries and areas has changed greatly. In the 2010s,the proportion of each family was Ommastrephidae (58. 41%) ,Loliginidae (11. 98%) ,Octopodidae (8. 92%) ,and Sepiidae (8. 40%) . Asia has played the important role in the cephalopod fishery in the world for more than 40 years. Japanese cephalopod production fell from 1st in the 1970s to 5th in the 1990s and 2010s,and China rose from 5th in the 1970s to 1st in the 2000s and 2010s. The lack of knowing,developing and controlling abilities over pelagic squid resources is a major constraint on the sustainable development of pelagic squid fisheries in China. Therefore,a global information service system should be developed on the fishing conditions of pelagic squid fisheries,a system for the standardization of fishing gear and equipment with independent property rights,the catch quality control technologies and traceability systems should be developed,information-based construction of ocean-going fisheries should be carried out based on Internet of Things projects,and the cephalopod fishery resources assessment system should be established.","摘要:头足类是世界上最具开发潜力的渔业种类之一,已成为世界海洋捕捞业的重要组成。根据1970 2016年世界各国头足类生产统计数据,利用灰色关联方法,对世界头足类渔业及其组成进行了分析;结合我国远洋鱿钓渔业的发展状况,指出存在的问题并提出发展对策。分析认为: 19702016年世界头足类捕捞产量总体上呈现出较为稳定的增长趋势,年增长率达到3. 68%,远高于同期世界海洋捕捞产量的增长率,2014年达到历史最高产量。20102016年,头足类捕捞产量占世界捕捞产量的比重稳定在4. 5% ~ 6. 0%。不同年代柔鱼科、枪乌贼科、乌贼科和章鱼科的产量组成及其比重有所差异,主要生产国家和地区的产量排序发生了很大的变化,2010年代各科所占比重依次为柔鱼类(58. 41%) 、枪乌贼类(11. 98%) 、章鱼类(8. 92%) 、乌贼类(8. 40%) 。亚洲在40多年的世界头足类渔业组成中地位极为重要,日本头足类产量从1970年代到1990年代的第1位下降到2010年代的第5位,我国从1970年代的第5位上升到2000年代和2010年代的第1位。对大洋性鱿鱼资源的认知能力、开发能力和掌控能力不足是制约我国远洋鱿钓渔业可持续发展的主要问题,为此提出建立与国际接轨的全球远洋渔业资源调查与生产性探捕的监测体系,研制全球远洋鱿钓渔业渔海况信息服务系统,建立自主产权的渔具及标准化装备体系,研发渔获品质控制技术与溯源体系,开展基于物联网工程的远洋渔业信息化建设,建立起我国主导研究的头足类渔业资源评估体系等建议与对策。",作者关键词:cephalopods; oceanic squid fishing; sustainable development,作者关键词:头足类; 远洋鱿钓; 可持续发展
Single-Bit Feedback Algorithm Based Distributed Coordinated Multi-Points Microwave Power Transmission Method,基于单比特反馈的分布式多点协作微波输能方法,2019,"The wide application of wireless sensors and mobile electronic devices promotes the research of wireless power transmission (WPT) ,while the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing of wireless devices in recent years broaden the application of WPT. As an effective method of WPT,microwave power transmission (MPT) has the advantage that it can transmit power in a large distance. With the use of distributed coordinated multi-points (CoMP) ,which is widely used in wireless communications,power can be transmitted in shadows and the transmission efficiency is increased. However,the current research of CoMP-MPT achieves coordination by measuring phases of multi-points with expensive hardware,which is hard to increase efficiency by increasing number of points because of the cost. To solve this problem,a new method based on single bit feedback algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm achieves coordination without complex multiplication but only amplitude feedback,so it reduces the cost of hardware obviously with little reducing of power transmission efficiency. Computer simulation results show that the transmission efficiency would achieve near 5% when 64 omnidirectional transmitters are equipped. Experimental results show that the power gain is 15. 6 dB if seven coordinated transmitters are used. The proposed low-cost scheme makes it possible to equip large number of transmitters,which leads to the increasing of transmission efficiency.","摘要:无线传感器和移动电子设备的普及推动了无线输能技术的研究,并随着近年物联网技术的发展,无线节点大幅增加,无线输能有了更广泛的应用空间。微波输能作为一种有效的无线输能方式,具有能量传输距离远的优势,而利用在无线通信上被广泛应用的分布式多点协作技术,还可在遮挡环境下输能,并能提升输能效率。但是目前已有研究通过各节点检测相位以进行协作,输能节点成本较高,难以通过增加节点数量以提升效率。为此本文提出使用单比特反馈方法,免去了复数乘除法计算,只检测幅度实现协作,在输能效率小幅下降的代价下大幅降低了各节点的硬件成本。通过仿真得出在64个全向节点下能达近5%的输能效率;实验验证在七个输能节点下可获得15. 6 dB增益。本文提出的低成本方案使得通过增加发射节点来提升输能效率变得可行。",作者关键词:wireless power transmission; microwave power transmission; multi-point cooperation; distributed beamforming,作者关键词:无线输能; 微波输能; 多点协作; 分布式波束形成

development,and it is also the key to promoting high-quality economic and social development.In the context of global integration and rapid digital development,the ability of a country to master and use big data will become an important manifestation of national competitiveness.Big data development has been put on the global agenda.The major countries in the world have successively released big data strategies.Organizations such as the United Nations,the World Bank,and the World Economic Forum etc.have also released reports to actively explore the relationship between big data and economic and social development.Therefore,it is becoming more and more urgent to develop a scientific and reasonable big data policy system to support the high-quality development of big data.The relevant research on big data policy in the academic world mainly focuses on the comparative research on the spatial dimension,lacking of systematic analysis on big data policy of its evolution,policy networks,the evolution of policy thematic word,and the use of policy instruments.Based on this,this paper will start from the two dimensions of policy instrument and policy thematic word,make a textual quantitative analysis of those policies from four aspects by constructing "" Policy Instrument--Policy Thematic Word "" two-dimensional analytical framework.The four aspects are as follows:the evolution of China's big data policies,policy networks of big data policies,the evolution of policy thematic words,and the use of policy instruments.The big data policy texts selected in this paper are all from public data sources,mainly collected from the websites of the Chinese government and the ministries and commissions.In order to reflect the status quo of China's big data policy more comprehensively,the original policy texts are obtained by searching for keywords such asbig data,artificial intelligence,informatizationandcloud computingand so on.On that basis,a total of 94 policy texts related to big data were selected as the analysis objects.This paper regards 2000 as the start of China' s big data policy research.The reason is that the bursting of the tech and telecom bubble in 2000,which threatened to pull the economy into recession.In order to help the software and the integrated circuit industries,the State Planning Commission (now renamed the National Development and Reform Commission) and other 13 ministries and commissions jointly issued a policy <Several Policies for Encouraging the Development of Software Industry and Integrated Circuit Industry >,to support the development of the software industry and integrated circuit industry.It is a crucial time for the rapid development of the information industry.The research results show that the development of big data policy in China has experienced a development process from emphasizing infrastructure construction to focus on industrial cultivation and innovation,and then to build a big data policy system.In the first stage of thedevelopment process of the big data policy system,the government mainly focuses on the infrastructure construction related to big data.In the second stage,the government focuses on promoting the research and development and demonstration and application projects of the Internet of Things,Cloud Computing,Big Data,the Chinese government is also putting an intensive focus on strategic emerging industries.The third stage of the development process is the construction stage of China's big data policy system.The Chinese government takes the development of the big data as its national strategy to promote the development of big data.At different stages of the development process of big data policy,policy themes are closely related to the economic,social and international environment at that

Experimental research of MPMD matching algorithm based on the GRPM underground positioning,基于GRPM井下定位的MPMD匹配算法的试验研究,2019,"Experimental research and theoretical analysis of MPMD matching algorithm based on the GRPM underground positioningHigh-precision positioning service is important for the underground production management,the intelligent escape and the emergency search. A novel method named GRPM was proposed in this paper, which is the combination of the radio frequency identification and the geomagnetic matching. GRPM is the positioning method with a high precision,autonomous,and suitable for the mine Internet of Things. The MPMD algorithm based on GRPM is a matching model for the optimal estimation of the joint distance of two-dimensional magnetic parameters,which can solve the problem of low accuracy of geomagnetic matching because the spatial distribution of geomagnetic anomaly field is not obvious, slowly changing or similar. Two horizontal roadways named H-11 and H-21 in simulated mine were selected in the study. The suitability of geomagnetic positioning in the H-21 roadway is good and in the H-11 roadway is poor,which were obtained through the statistical analysis of the mean,standard deviation,roughness and information entropy of their geomagnetic data. The geomagnetic matching studies with MSD,MAD,and MPMD algorithms in the H-11 and H-21 roadways were carried out to compare the positioning accuracy and anti-noise performance of the three algorithms under the conditions of geomagnetic variation and noise disturbance. The study results show that the matching probability of the three matching algorithms all reached more than 95% in the roadway H-21 with abundant geomagnetic features, the matching accuracy of MPMD is higher than that of MSD and MAD, its matching error keep within a grid. MPMD algorithm is better than MSD and MAD algorithm in dealing with the problem of fuzzy matching value in H-11 roadway with poor geomagnetic features, and its matching results show few false locations. The algorithm performance was tested in the H-21 roadway,there is a small amount of false location in the MSD and MAD matching under the 200 nT measurement noise, and the matching result of MPMD is nearly error-free. There are a lot of virtual localization in the matching result of MSD and MAD under the 400 nT or 600 nT measurement noise, and MPMD has a few false locations, and the matching probability still reaches 89%.

Near-End Cloud Computing:Opportunities and Challenges in the Post-Cloud Computing Era,近端云计算:后云计算时代的机遇与挑战,2019,"Cloud computing is a form of network computing paradigm that can provide on-demand access to shared pools of configurable computing resources,such as computation,storage,and services.Since its introduction in 2007,it has attracted a lot of attention and has developed rapidly over the last decade.In recent years,with the rapid development of pervasive smart devices and ubiquitous network technologies,various kinds of new network applications and services are continuously emerging,such as the Internet of things,smart city,smart grid,virtual/augmented reality,unmanned vehicles.However,it is very difficult for cloud computing to meet the diverse requirements of these new network applications and services due to the characteristic of centralized computation and storage.The capabilities of heterogeneous devices and edge equipment are not fully leveraged in cloud computing.Cloud computing also encounters the bottleneck of heterogeneous and long-distance networks.Moreover,the demands of new complex network application scenarios,such as the Internet of Things and 5G,cannot be satisfied by cloud computing.To overcome the limitations of cloud computing,a variety of new network computing paradigms,such as fog computing,multi-access edge computing,and edge computing are proposed by industry and academia.Although they employ different terms,the basic idea of them is to extend cloud computing and move the computing infrastructure from remote data centers to edge routers,base stations and servers that are close to end-devices,thus overcoming the technology and application bottlenecks of cloud computing.In this paper,we collectively refer to these new network computing paradigms as near-end cloud computing paradigm.To make it easier to understand the underlying causes of the near-end cloud computing paradigm and to grasp the application scenarios and challenges of it,we systematically summarize the emerged near-end cloud computing paradigms in recent years and sum up the basic characteristics of them.First,the main technology and application bottlenecks encountered in the development of cloud computing are summarized and analyzed in detail.Second,the concept and architecture of the near-end cloud computing paradigm are introduced,and several near-end cloud computing paradigms,including fog computing,multiaccess edge computing,and edge computing are summarized.This shows that these near-end cloud computing paradigms are not completely different from cloud computing,but rather a natural extension of cloud computing from large-scale centralization to small-scale centralization and distribution,which can be regarded as a historical regression to the distributed computing paradigm.Third,the development opportunities associated with near-end cloud computing are discussed with application scenarios,including the Internet of Things,5G,smart grid,virtual/augmented reality,and unmanned aerial vehicle.Fourth,the technological challenges including architecture and model,network access and management,resource management and scheduling,pricing and incentive mechanism,security and privacy protection are discussed in details.Finally,the future development of near-end cloud computing is prospected.It is believed that as problems faced by cloud computing become increasingly prominent,near-end cloud computing will undoubtedly become a hot research topic in both the industrial and academic communities in the near future.","摘要:随着普适化智能终端以及泛在化网络技术的快速发展,新型网络应用和服务不断涌现,诸如物联网、智慧城市、智能电网、虚拟/增强现实、无人驾驶等.以集中式计算和存储为主要特征的云计算已经难以满足这些技术和应用的发展需求.近年来,为了克服云计算的局限性,雾计算、移动边缘计算以及边缘计算等近端云计算模式相继被提出并日益受到关注.这些计算模式虽然名称不一,但是其基本思想都是对云计算进行扩展,即将云计算基础设施从距离用户较远的数据中心移至距离用户终端较近的边缘路由器、移动基站或者服务器上,以克服云计算的技术和应用瓶颈.该文对近年来出现的近端云计算模式进行了系统综述,总结了当前几种近端云计算模式的基本特征.首先,分析了云计算在发展中所遇到的主要技术和应用瓶颈.其次,介绍了近端云计算模式的概念和架构,并总结了几种近端云计算模式.接着,讨论了近端云计算所面临的主要发展机遇和技术挑战.最后,对近端云计算的未来发展进行了展望.",作者关键词:cloud computing; fog computing; edge computing; mobile edge computing; multi-access edge computing,作者关键词:云计算; 雾计算; 边缘计算; 移动边缘计算; 多通路边缘计算

EasiDARM: Distributed Based Adaptive Register Method for Internet of Things,EasiDARM:基于分布式的物联网设备自适应注册方法,2019,"With the perfecting and practicability of the access protocols of the Internet of things (IoT), it is becoming a mainstream architecture to connect devices to cloud platforms for support of real-time access. Considering the dynamic nature of IoT devices and networks, we must make the devices register on the platforms periodically to ensure real-time access between the devices and the platforms. However, existing register methods cost much time and consume a lot of resources on devices, Internet and platforms; and what's more, the platforms will be overload when many devices or networks are dynamic. In this paper, we present a distributed based adaptive register method (EasiDARM) to reduce the costs of resources and time. By using multiple devices to complete the measurement of network address translation (NAT) timeout which is complex and time-consuming, and sharing the result of measurement among the devices, EasiDARM accelerates the processes of the measurement and self-adaption. The process of measurement is divided into fast update (FU) and fast converge (FC) stage, EasiDARM assigns and probes the candidate intervals with exponential growth during the FU stage to extend the register interval rapidly, and with linear growth during the FC stage to converge the measurement quickly. Through experiments show that compared with the traditional adaptive register method, EasiDARM can reduce 46% of time, 46% of consumption on devices and 53% of consumption on Internet and platforms in the process of measurement, and cut 36% of instantaneous consumption on platforms.","摘要:随着物联网水平化接入协议的逐步成熟与实用化,将设备接入云平台以对设备进行实时访问逐步成为一种主流架构.由于物联网设备或其所处网络环境存在动态性,为了保证物联网云平台与设备之间的双向实时访问,设备往往需要到云平台进行周期注册.而现有注册方法存在开销大、耗时长的缺点,当大量设备或网络处于强动态场景时,云平台的注册开销将急剧加大.为此,提出了基于分布式的物联网设备自适应注册方法(EasiDARM),将复杂且耗时的周期探测过程分配给多个设备执行,并通过参数同步实现结果实时共享,极大地加快周期探测和设备自适应过程,降低物端、网端和云端开销.该方法将周期探测过程分为""快更新""和""快收敛""前后2个阶段,""快更新""阶段采用指数增长方式进行任务分配及周期探测,加快注册周期增长速度,""快收敛""阶段采用线性增长方式进行任务分配及周期探测,加快周期探测收敛速度.实验结果表明:较于传统的自适应注册方法,该方法周期探测耗时能减少46%,物端开销能降低46%,网端通信开销和云端处理开销能降低53%;同时能使云平台的突发性开销降低36%.",作者关键词:Internet of things; massive device; device adaptive register; network address translation (NAT); task distribution,作者关键词:物联网; 海量设备; 设备自适应注册; 网络地址转换; 任务分配

Strongly Secure and Anonymous Two-Party Authenticated Key Agreement for Mobile Roaming Service,移动漫游中强安全的两方匿名认证密钥协商方案,2019,"As mobile devices usually have limited computing and storage resources, it is difficult to develop an anonymous two-party authentication scheme possessing performance efficiency and strong security simultaneously. The existing two-party authenticated key agreement schemes for roaming service do not resist the attack of ephemeral secrets reveal, and have high computation costs. Therefore,a new anonymous two-party authenticated key agreement scheme for roaming service was proposed in this paper, in which an efficiency identity-based signcryption scheme was adopted to achieve mutual authentication and unlinkability. The identity-based signcryption scheme is based on the Schnorr signature scheme,a very efficient elliptic curve digital signature algorithm,which greatly reduce the total computation cost during one authentication session in comparison with existing authentication schemes. Furthermore, to achieve the security of the ephemeral secrets reveal resistance in the new authentication scheme,we constructed a computational Diffie-Hellman problem instance that required two participants to compute a value by combining its own private key with its peers public key, respectively. We extended the eCK model to model the two-party authenticated key agreement schemes for roaming service,discussed the distinction between the security game of authenticated key agreement schemes for mobile roaming service and the general one, and demonstrated that the new scheme was provably secure in the extended eCK model. The conclusion indicates that the security of the new scheme can be reduced to solve the computational Diffie-Hellman problem on an elliptic curve over finite field by a polynomial-time adversary. Comparative analysis shows that our scheme has stronger security,needs less cryptography library, and has lower computing and communication overheads. The new scheme can be used to provide secure roaming authentication for resource constrained mobile terminals in global mobility networks, Internet of things or ubiquitous networks.","摘要:由于低功耗的移动设备计算和存储能力较低,设计一种高效且强安全的两方匿名漫游认证与密钥协商方案是一项挑战性的工作.现有方案不仅计算开销较高,而且不能抵抗临时秘密泄露攻击.针对这两点不足,提出一种新的两方匿名漫游认证与密钥协商方案.在新方案中,基于Schnorr签名机制,设计了一种高效的基于身份签密算法,利用签密的特性实现实体的相互认证和不可追踪;利用认证双方的公私钥直接构造了一个计算Diffie-Hellman(Computational Diffie-Hellman,CDH)问题实例,能抵抗临时秘密泄露攻击.新方案实现了可证明安全,在eCK(extended Canetti-Krawczyk)模型基础上,探讨两方漫游认证密钥协商方案安全证明过程中可能出现的情形,进行归纳和拓展,并给出新方案的安全性证明,其安全性被规约为多项式时间敌手求解椭圆曲线上的CDH问题.对比分析表明:新方案安全性更强,需要实现的算法库更少,计算和通信开销较低.新方案可应用于移动通信网络、物联网或泛在网络,为资源约束型移动终端提供漫游接入服务.",作者关键词:authenticated key agreement; mobile roaming service; identity-based cryptography; computational Diffie- Hellman problem; eCK(extended Canetti-Krawczyk) model,作者关键词:认证密钥协商; 移动漫游服务; 基于身份密码体制; 计算Diffie-Hellman问题; 扩展的CK模型

Research on Location-Driven Buffer Management of End Nodes in Internet of Things,节点位置信息驱动的物联网终端缓存管理机制的研究,2019,"Internet of Things(IOT),which exploits the association among the objects,the sensing devices and the Internet,achieves the automatic and real-time management,i.e.,recognition, localization,tracking,monitoring,and triggers the related events.Facing the continuous data flow collected from the monitored environment or transferred from other nodes,the mobile nodes of IOT have to conduct a large amount of data interactions.With the limited buffer size of nodes, a rational buffer management mechanism is expected to improve the delivery ratio of messages, reduce the network overhead and maintain a low level of energy cost in the nodes.However,the existing research efforts on the buffer management mechanisms,which mainly focus on the aspect of message queue features or the static attributes of messages,neglect some characteristics,e.g., the location and moving direction of nodes.Therefore,the untargeted spread of messages,which results in the heavy network overhead,occurs in the network.Although some research efforts have considered the mobility pattern of the node,they mainly focus on the time dimension,e.g., the time interval between any two contact events among nodes.Moreover,many assumptions of node contacts,e.g.,the encounter time interval among nodes follows the independent and identical distribution,result in a limited practical application scenario of the buffer management algorithms. Considering the spatial regularity of node mobility,this paper proposes a location-driven buffer management mechanism based on the analysis of different mobility models.With the knowledge of the messages destination location,the mobility characteristics of the node location-direction in both random mobility model and the vehicular mobility model are applied to calculate the priority of messages.Based on the message priority,the buffer scheduling policies,when two contacted nodes need to exchange messages with each other,and the necessary dropping policies when the buffer depletion occurs,are designed.The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated by organizing the simulation under both random movement scenarios,e.g.,human hold mobile devices or animal carried sensors,and the limited movement scenarios,e.g.,the taxis,buses and private cars in the urban roads.The results of simulation reveal that compared with other traditional buffer management policies,e.g.,Drop-Oldest(DO),the proposed mechanism shows a promoted performance.Under different buffer sizes and different degrees of network congestion,the proposed buffer management mechanism can improve the message delivery ratio,and reduce the average delivery latency,the network overload ratio and the average hops at the same time.","摘要:物联网通过物体、传感设备与网络的关联来实现物体自动、实时的识别、定位、追踪和监控,并触发相关事件.面对持续采集或到达的数据流,物联网的移动终端间需要进行大量的数据交互.在节点缓存空间有限的条件下,合理的节点缓存管理机制可以在提高消息投递成功率的同时减少网络开销、降低终端能耗.然而,现有缓存管理机制都是从消息队列特征或静态属性方面展开研究,忽视了节点的位置、移动方向等特征,从而导致消息在网络中无方向性的扩散;或虽考虑了节点移动特征,但集中于时间维度,且对节点间相遇规律做了诸多假设,如节点间相遇服从独立同分布等,这些都限制了算法的实际应用场景.考虑到物联网中节点移动的空间规律性,该文在研究节点移动模型的基础上提出了节点位置信息驱动的终端缓存管理机制.在消息目的位置已知的情况下,该机制根据节点在随机移动模型和车载移动模型两种场景下位置和方向的移动特征,结合节点对网络态势的感知,分别计算消息的优先级;依据该优先级,设计节点间进行数据交换时的消息调度策略及节点缓存空间不足时的消息丢弃策略;并通过对移动方式随机(如人和动物的随机移动)和移动方式受限(如城市道路中车辆移动)两种场景的仿真结果分析,评估算法的性能表现.仿真实验表明,相比于Drop Oldest(DO)等传统缓存管理策略,该文提出的缓存管理机制在不同缓存大小和不同程度网络拥塞的情况下体现出较高的性能优势,并在提升消息投递率的同时保持了较低的平均时延、网络负载率和平均跳数.",作者关键词:Internet of Things; buffer management; random mobility model; vehicular mobility model,作者关键词:物联网; 缓存管理; 随机移动模型; 车载移动模型

First,to shorten the execution time,we propose a passive tag data collection protocol ( PTC),in which every frame is divided into several slots of different sizes. We then propose a data collection protocol,ATC,for the active tags. This protocol pre-allocates time slots to reduce the allocation of empty slots and the number of conflicting slots,which enables the execution time to reach lower bounds. To collect information accurately and reliably,we propose an effective algorithm ADMCU that detects missing tags and collects unknown tags,thereby providing a guarantee for the PTC and ATC protocols. Our experimental results show that the two protocols proposed in this paper have shorter execution times than other popular protocols. Moreover,no matter how much information is collected,the execution time of ATC is always the shortest.

Multi-feature Data Fusion Method of Greenhouse Based on WDNN,基于WDNN的温室多特征数据融合方法研究,2019,"The IoT monitoring products are widely used in greenhouse production,which could generate massive data. The existing data fusion algorithms for greenhouses had low fusion accuracy and weak generalization capability for high-dimensional features and mixed features (combined with sparse features and continuous features) . It was rare to use the deep learning model to top-level fusion of greenhouse data and provide accurate decision information. Aiming at the above problems,a two-level greenhouse environment data fusion algorithm was proposed based on wide-deep neural network (WDNN) . Firstly, integrating multi-point multi-features mixed data in the greenhouse and marking the data categories. Then the constructed training set and test set were input into the WDNN deep learning model for 2000-step iteration training. The model structure was set as 7-100-50-7,the output form was multi-point single feature,which was the first-level fusion result as decision information of each area of the greenhouse,and then the output data was second-level fusion according to the minority obeyed majority principle,and the overall evaluation decision of the greenhouse environmental state was obtained. For comparison purposes, the other three fusion models were trained as deep neutral network (DNN) ,BP neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) . The experimental results showed that the loss value of the initial segment of the WDNN network was higher than that of DNN network,but the loss function curve had a faster rate of decline and the model parameters were better. The accuracy of the model after training was 4. 32 percentage points higher than that of DNN,but the training time was increased by 21. 36%; the accuracy of BPNN model was 82% and its parameter optimization was the slowest,parameter optimization required more iteration steps; RF model training speed was the fastest,but its model fusion accuracy was 3. 39 percentage points lower than that of WDNN.

Inputting the mixed situation information contained the sensor anomaly and meteorological data under various conditions into the fusion system,then the context decision rate reached 98. 90%. The realization of the WDNN fusion system could be used to monitor greenhouses with more parameters and more complex environments,and enrich the fusion feature categories while ensuring the accuracy of decision-making.

Is the East Asian flora ancient or not?,,2018,"The East Asian flora (EAF) is a key biodiversity hotspot for understanding the origin and evolution of Northern Hemisphere floras, but there is an ongoing debate on whether it is a museum or a cradle for seed plants. Within the EAF, two main floras, the Sino-Himalayan Flora (mainly the Rhododendron Flora) and the Sino-Japanese Flora (mainly the Metasequoia Flora), have been recognized. Previous studies suggested that the EAF is ancient and the Metasequoia Flora is older than the Rhododendron Flora. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized molecular as well as fossil data on seed plants, focusing on the biogeographical origins and historical evolution of the EAF. We compared the ages of its two constituent floras, and examined the impact of the Asian monsoon and other environmental changes on the development of EAF through meta-analysis. Our results suggest that the EAF might be relatively young, with most of its clades originating since the Miocene. The Rhododendron Flora and the Metasequoia Flora are probably of a similar age. The formation and development of the Asian monsoon might have been the main factors that have driven the evolution of EAF. In the Rhododendron Flora, the north-south mountain chains increased the concentration of species and reduced extinction, and the barriers between the east and west have resulted in species differentiation, which triggered it to become a diversity center. The EAF appears to have multiple biogeographical origins, having closely affiliated not only with other floras in the Northern Hemisphere, but also with Gondwanan floras.",,作者关键词:Asian monsoon; East Asian Flora; Metasequoia Flora; Rhododendron Flora; temporal and spatial evolution,

Physical layer security performance analysis of full-duplex wireless-powered IoT networks,全双工无线供能物联网的物理层安全性能分析,2018,"Facing to jammers and eavesdroppers, conventional security data transmission is generally based on the cryptographic method. Enormous issues arise when the cryptographic method applied in dynamic wireless scenarios, such as key distribution for symmetric cryptosystems, and high computing complexity of asymmetric cryptosystems. With the rapid growing of wireless traffic and massive device accessing of Internet-of-Things (IoT) , the computing complexity and energy consumption aggravate, which leads to security degrade of wireless networks. To address this issue, a secure communication scheme based on physical layer security was proposed for Full-Duplex (FD) wireless-powered IoT networks, which limited the amount of information received at the unauthorized receiver by exploiting the randomness of noise and wireless channel. In this method, secrecy capacity was analyzed based on information theory, and then the Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP) was derived with the analysis model of secrecy capacity. In addition, considering the influence of noise, jammer interference, spatial mutual interference, and residual self-interference on safety capacity, a secure beamforming method was proposed to increase the mutual information between the transmitting and receiving ends and improve the secrecy capacity of the full-duplex wireless-powered IoT network by decreasing the joint interference. Derivation results are verified through Monte Carlo simulation.

In hostile environments, the adversaries are prone to illegally obtain the information stored on the master nodes, which are known as the key nodes of TWSNs, and even destroy the integrity of the query results returned to Sink node by capturing the master nodes and making them malicious. In this paper, we focus on the problem of privacy-and-integrity preservation for Top-k queries in TWSNs and propose a secure query-processing protocol named VPP (verifiable privacy-and-integrity preservation). Based on the OPES (order preserving encryption scheme), the SC (symmetric ciphering) and the weight binding techniques, VPP achieves privacy-and-integrity preservation for Top-k queries by specifying the data preprocessing mechanism at the sensor nodes, the Top-k query-processing mechanism at the storage nodes, and the integrity-validating method at Sink node.

Incremental Indoor Localization for Device Diversity Issues,针对设备差异性问题的增量式室内定位方法,2018,"With the rapid development of Wireless Local Area Network(WLAN),the Received Signal Strength(RSS) based indoor localization becomes a hot area in research and application fields.Among various kinds of up-to-date indoor localization methods,fingerprint based methods are most widely used because of its good performance,and one feature of those methods is that the accuracy is determined by the identification of the training and the testing dataset.Howe-ver,in practical applications,there are three problems in existing fingerprint based methods or system.Firstly,the loca-lization error caused by device variance is a severe problem.Secondly,the wireless data are changing as the time passed,leading to the reduction of the prediction accuracy.Thirdly,traditional fingerprint based methods or system cannot avoid the dependency on a large amount of labeled data to keep effective positioning performance,which usually involves high cost in labor and time.To solve these problems,this paper proposed a incremental indoor localization method for device diversity issues,which keeps real-time update by training uncalibrated data that collected in localization.Experimental results show that the proposed method can increase the precision of overall indoor localization system,especially when error distance is between 3 and 5 meters.What's more,this method possesses good advantage of timeliness compared with traditional indoor localization method on real BLE dataset.","摘要:随着WLAN的普及,基于RSS(Received Signal Strength)的室内定位方法逐渐成为研究与应用的热点。其中,基于指纹的定位方法已成为主流,此类方法的特点之一在于要求离线训练数据与在线测试数据满足独立同分布,然而,在实际环境中,现有的指纹定位方法或系统存在以下3个问题:1)不同终端设备的无线通讯硬件存在差异性,训练数据和测试数据的采集设备之间的差异性将严重影响定位精度;2)环境中的无线信号呈现高动态性,采集的数据存在显著的时效性,因此由训练数据得到的模型的定位性能将随着时间的推移不断下降;3)传统增量式定位模型需要大量的标定数据,不具有实际可用性。为解决以上问题,提出了一种针对设备差异性问题的增量式室内定位方法,利用终端在持续定位服务中采集的无标记数据来实时更新定位模型。实验表明,在实际蓝牙定位数据集上,相比于传统的定位模型方法,所提方法的整体定位精度更高,误差距离为3~5m时,其优势更为明显;同时,该方法具有时效优势,能够长时间保持有效定位。",作者关键词:Indoor localization; Device diversity; Incremental learning; Extreme learning machine; Internet of things,作者关键词:室内定位; 设备差异性; 增量学习; 极速学习机; 物联网

Survey on Approximate Storage Techniques,近似存储技术综述,2018,"With the rapid development of cloud computing and Internet of things, how to store the explosively growing data becomes a challenge for storage systems. In tackling this challenge, approximate storage technology draws broad attention for its huge potential in saving the cost of storage and improving the system performance. Approximate storage techniques trade off the accuracy of the outputs for performance or energy efficiency taking advantages of the intrinsic tolerance to inaccuracies of many common applications. In this way, the applications improve their performance or energy efficiency while meeting the user requirements.

Design and experiment of rice program control germination system in cold region based on internet of things,基于物联网技术的寒地水稻程控催芽系统设计与试验,2018,"Rice is one of main food crops in the world, and rice yield accounts for 37.3% in total food yield in China, so the technology of rice yield increase becomes a research hot point. Seed soaking and pregermination technology is an important technology in rice cultivation, especially in cold region of China. Rice is very susceptible to frost damage, and therefore rice needs an accumulated temperature compensation to prolong rice growth stage. Rice seeds can acquire effective accumulated temperature of 100 ℃ through seed soaking and pregermination technology. The whole process of seed soaking and pregermination has 3 stages: Soaking seeds, seeds budding and seeds germination. The temperature range of soaking seeds stage is from 11 to 13 ℃, the second stage is seeds budding process which needs a temperature range from 31 to 33 ℃, and the third stage is seeds germination process which needs a temperature range from 26 to 28 ℃. However, in the present condition, there are several serious problems in large-scale rice soaking and pregermination in cold region: The upper and lower water temperatures are not uniform during the soaking process, and seeds aerobic respiration is not good in large-scale sprouting tank. These problems are easy to cause lower budding ratio of seeds or thin weak seedlings. Further, these problems will cause severe loss in yield and quality of rice. To solve these problems, the activation mechanism of seed germination was studied firstly. This mechanism included the effect of soaking temperature and time on the physiological activity of rice seeds. Secondly, temperature and humidity monitoring system of sprouting tank was introduced based on internet of things technology. This system included 3 parts: Infrastructure used for placing the seeds, electric heater, circulation pipe line, solenoid valve, and so on; intelligent monitoring system used for production data acquisition, data display, data storage and production equipment control based on sensor technology and computer technology; remote monitoring and data service system used for remote virtual control of production equipment and managing of multiple production bases based on network technology. This system could be used for automated management of sprouting tank environment parameters. Thirdly, we divided the temperature field into 3 layers: Upper layer, middle layer and under layer, and we simulated the temperature field of sprouting tank with MATLAB software. The simulation results of temperature field showed that control accuracy of system was high, and the temperature uniformity was good in the sprouting tank. The results of sprouting experiment also showed that the germination rate could reach 97.79%, the degree of buds uniformity and haleness were improved substantially, the temperature control accuracy could reach 0.2 ℃, and the water level control accuracy could reach 0.3%. This research provides a kind of new technical support for the improvement of the rice soaking and pregermination, and at the same time, this technology shows better social and economic benefits.","摘要:针对大规模寒地水稻芽种生产中,浸种、破胸、催芽3个环节存在的上下层水温不均匀、浸种箱内稻种有氧呼吸差,易导致种子出芽率低甚至发生烧种、烂芽等问题,研究了浸泡温度、时间对水稻种子生理活性的激发机理,构建了基于物联网技术的温度、湿度、氧气监控体系,研发了程控水稻催芽系统,实现浸种箱内催芽环境分段式自动化管理。通过对浸种箱内温度场模拟及大田生产试验证明:系统温、湿、氧调控准确度高,均匀性好,水温控制精度0.2℃,水位控制精度0.3%,种子发芽率达97.79%,箱内不同区域芽种出芽率相差1%以内,芽种整齐度、健壮程度大幅提高。该系统研究为寒地水稻生产水平的提高提供了技术支撑,体现了较好的社会经济效益。",作者关键词:seed; temperature control; sensors; rice in cold region; soaking and pregermination; aerobic respiration; germination rate,作者关键词:种子; 温度控制; 传感器; 寒地水稻; 浸种催芽; 有氧呼吸; 发芽率
Design and application of monitoring system for crab breeding base based on internet of things,基于物联网的螃蟹养殖基地监控系统设计及应用,2018,"Aquaculture plays a vital role in our social and economic life, but its long production cycle, high labor intensity, low production efficiency, large waste of resources, and severe susceptibility to disease, significantly restrict the healthy development of the aquaculture industry. Facing a growing consumer market, traditional farming methods are increasingly unable to meet the demands of the public, creating great uncertainty in this crucial industry. This paper aims to develop a holistic management system for the crab farming, by combining technologies such as internet of things (according to the three-layer architecture of service layer, application layer and executive layer) and big data to systematically monitor and control aspects across the entire system. The system mainly includes the following aspects: 1) Aquaculture center water quality and environment sensor network: A distributed sensor network is required for continuous and real-time monitoring of key water quality parameters (including dissolved oxygen, pH value, and temperature), and such a system would be arranged within the water, together with underwater cameras, to provide a constant stream of data for processing. Additionally, information from a second network of local meteorological sensors (such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, barometric pressure, rainfall and illumination) will be gathered, and when combined with the underwater data, a complete data monitoring network will be formed based on the internet of things technology. 2) Intelligent control network of farming center: Aquaculture equipment mainly includes aerators, feeders, and so on, with management approaches to these being low-tech, not optimized and wasteful currently. Through real-time analysis of water quality data, the growth cycle of aquatic crops, and their active morphological data can be fed into a learning model, which will determine the optimum oxygen content at any given moment and allow real-time precise control of the aerator. Furthermore, predicting the hunger time of the aquatic species will enable accurate feeding regimes, greatly avoiding wastage of precious resources and improving production efficiency. Users can remotely browse data in any place with network coverage through a computer browser or mobile phone App. The server of the entire system is hosted at the Shanghai Ocean University's network management center, deployed on the server website, mobile phone App service background, and so on. The system adopts embedded single-chip microcomputer (STC15F2K60S2) as the bottom layer controller chip, and communicates with the sensor by RS485 protocol. Each subsystem network uses ESP8266 WIFI module to connect AP(access point) station and the video surveillance uses EZVIZ cloud platform. PLC (programmable logic controller) is the control part for the aquaculture equipment. The system has passed the actual debugging in the Chongming crab breeding base, which belongs to Shanghai Ocean University, and all the indicators meet the requirements. The accuracy of each parameter reaches the detection standard. Up to now, the system is stable in operation and can meet the requirements of aquaculture. By testing, the communication success rate of the whole system is more than 98%, and the average relative errors of dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH value are 0.016 mg/L, 0.031 ℃, and 0.023, respectively.

CREBAD: Chip Radio Emission Based Anomaly Detection Scheme of IoT Devices,CREBAD:基于芯片辐射的物联网设备异常检测方案,2018,"with the rapid development of the Internet of things (IoT), IoT security issues have received widespread attention. The hardware and software features of IoT devices make them extremely vulnerable to all types of attacks. Anomaly detection of IoT devices has become a hot spot in recent years. The traditional protection methods based on intrusion detection and traffic analysis can not adapt to the hardware and software environment of IoT devices. In order to solve this problem, an anomaly detection scheme based on chip radiation is proposed. By using the electromagnetic wave signals of IoT devices radiating outwards during operation as detection basis, the original signals are extracted and selected by genetic algorithm and approximate entropy. Finally, the signal of normal behavior radiation is trained using a one-class support vector machine algorithm. The program has non-invasive features, without the need for any transformation of the original system hardware and software, applying to the existing IoT devices. The final experimental results show that compared with other commonly used anomaly detection schemes, this scheme can detect the abnormal behavior of IoT devices more effectively, with higher accuracy and lower false alarm rate.","摘要:随着物联网的飞速发展,物联网设备的安全问题受到了广泛的关注.物联网设备的软硬件特性导致其极易遭受各类攻击.对物联网设备的异常检测成为近年的热点,传统的基于入侵检测、流量分析等防护方式无法适用于物联网设备的软硬件环境.针对这一问题,提出了基于芯片辐射的异常检测方案,以物联网设备在工作时向外辐射的电磁波信号作为检测依据,采用遗传算法和近似熵理论对原始信号进行特征提取和选择后,利用一类支持向量机对正常行为产生的辐射信号进行训练.该方案具有无侵入的特性,无需对原有系统进行任何软硬件改造,适用于现有物联网设备.最后的实验结果表明:与其他常用的异常检测方案相比,该方案能够更有效地检测物联网设备的异常行为,具有较高的准确性和较低的误报率.",作者关键词:anomaly detection; IoT device; radio emission; one-class SVM; clustering,作者关键词:异常检测; 物联网设备; 无线电辐射; 一类支持向量机; 聚类
Blockchain-Based Trust Management Framework for Distributed Internet of Things,基于区块链的分布式物联网信任管理方法研究,2018,"With the development of the Internet of things (IoT) technology, a new scenario emerges among various IoT networks in which different IoT networks form a large-scale, heterogeneous and dynamic distributed IoT environment. There is a need for various cooperations among devices and IoT authorities, for which it is necessary to establish a trust mechanism to promote cooperation. However, the existing researches on trust mechanism are mostly separated from the IoT environment, and do not consider the resource limitations of IoT devices as well as great differences among them in computing and storage capabilities, which results in the study of abstract trust mechanisms can not be directly applied to IoT. On the other hand, the existing researches on the issues of IoT trust rely on additional trusted third-party or inter-domain trust assumption, which is hard to be achieved in practice. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a trust management method which is suitable for distributed IoT with the help of blockchain and risk theory. Specifically, we embody the abstract concept of trust as an examination of expected credit and risk, and enable effective sharing of trust data using blockchain. Experimental simulation and analysis show that our method can quantify the trust effectively, protect the data from being tampered and have lower storage cost.","摘要:随着物联网(Internet of things, IoT)技术的发展,在不同的物联网之间逐渐形成了大规模、异构化、动态化的分布式物联网环境.分布式物联网内的设备间与物联网管理机构间存在着广泛的合作需求,为此需要在其中建立信任机制以促进合作.然而,现有的信任机制研究大部分脱离于物联网环境,没有考虑物联网设备计算与存储能力有限且差异较大这一特点,造成抽象信任机制研究无法直接应用于物联网中;另一方面,现有的物联网信任问题研究都依赖于额外的可信第三方或域间信任假设,这在实际中是难以实现的.为了解决上述问题,借助区块链与风险理论,提出一种适用于分布式物联网的信任管理方法.具体地,将信任量化为对期望信用与风险的考察,并借助区块链实现信任数据的有效共享与安全性.实验与分析表明:该方案能够有效量化信任,保护数据不被篡改,且能够以较低的存储开销维护系统的正常运行.",作者关键词:trust management; distributed systems; Internet of things (IoT); risk; blockchain,作者关键词:信任管理; 分布式系统; 物联网; 风险; 区块链

Efficient Detection of False Data Fusion in IoT,高效物联网虚假数据融合结果检测机制,2018,"Data fusion is the critical process for data transmission in the Internet of things (IoT). In data fusion process, the original sensing data is processed and aggregated in the network, and only the aggregated results of data fusion are sent to the application layer, which effectively reduces the resource consumption and alleviates the workload on the sink node. Since no network node caches the aggregated data in the data fusion process, it is impossible to detect and locate the false data injection attack against data fusion results. In order to mitigate this significant vulnerability, an efficient detection scheme of false data fusion is proposed in this paper. By modeling the data fusion process, we discover and model the relationship between the input data and the fusion results, and apply the obtained model to detect abnormal data fusion results. In this way, we can mitigate malicious data fusion and optimize the IoT transmission security. In detail, we first collect input data and the relevant data fusion results for each node, and a compressed feature representation mechanism is designed to improve the data collection efficiency and reduce the resource consumption. In addition, a data fusion model based on probabilistic graph model is proposed to depict the spatial and temporal relationship between the input data and the data fusion results. Ultimately, we take the model to detect the abnormal data fusion results in an efficient way. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed detection scheme can detect malicious data fusion operations efficiently and accurately and thus guarantee IoT transmission security.","摘要:数据融合(data fusion)是物联网数据传输和处理的关键步骤之一,在传输过程中提前汇总和处理中间数据,仅将逐层融合的结果发送到应用层,有效降低了中间节点的功耗和负载.然而,在这一过程中,各节点没有保存被融合数据,因此,无法发现和定位针对数据融合结果的数据伪造或篡改攻击.为了杜绝这一安全隐患,提出一种高效的物联网数据融合安全检验机制,通过对数据融合过程建模,发现并刻画被输入数据和融合结果之间的联系,并利用这一模型发现异常的数据融合结果,杜绝恶意数据融合,优化物联网传输安全.首先,在节点/网络的输入端和输出端分别进行数据收集,构建了基于被融合数据的特征压缩摘要机制,提升了数据收集效率并优化了节点资源消耗;其次,提出了基于概率图概率模型的数据融合模型,描述被融合数据和融合结果的时空域关系,并基于这一模型高效检测异常数据融合结果.实验结果表明:所提出的方法能够高效、准确地发现恶意数据融合操作,优化物联网传输安全.",作者关键词:Internet of things (IoT); in-network data fusion; data fusion model; lightweight; efficiency; detection of false data injection,作者关键词:物联网; 网内数据融合; 数据融合模型; 轻量级; 高效; 数据篡改攻击检测
A Large-Scale Cross-Platform Homologous Binary Retrieval Method,一种大规模的跨平台同源二进制文件检索方法,2018,"Due to the extensive code reuse, homologous binaries are widely found in IoT firmwares. Once a vulnerability is found in one firmware, other firmwares sharing the similar piece of codes are at high risk.

Key Update and Trusted Positioning System Based on Blockchain,基于区块链的密钥更新和可信定位系统,2018,"With the development Internet of Things (IoT), the number of intelligent devices is increasing rapidly. The ad hoc network mode of wireless intelligent devices has dynamic topology and decentralized distribution and does not have a fixed infrastructure. However, these features bring many problems to the security of communication and positioning. Firstly, the combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes is applied to achieve secure communications between IoT devices, while once a private key is lost or leaked, it is hard to synchronize the latest keys in the whole ad hoc network. Secondly, complicated interaction and computation are usually needed for key agreement among devices in ad hoc networks. Thirdly, under some circumstances, it can be a great challenge for ad hoc intelligent devices to receive signal from the trusted third party which is also required to be always online, but the existing ad hoc positioning system cannot remain secure when lacking of trusted third party like base station. Finally, the existing positioning algorithm cannot protect positioning signal untampered, and it is difficult to ensure the accuracy of the positioning displayed by each mobile device in the ad hoc network. In view of the above problems, we propose this system by using blockchains established between wireless IoT devices as the trusted infrastructure to record the key update chain corresponding to the user identity and facilitate the session key agreement among multiple users. Based on the consensus mechanism, the system enables trusted mutual positioning among IoT devices when there is no or weak positioning signal, and it protects the authenticity of positioning information sent or received by devices. The system can be built by the existing secure cryptographic algorithms, enabling secure and efficient key updates and trusted positioning, and it is adapted for use in actual devices in secure IoT systems.","摘要:随着物联网技术发展,智能设备数量激增,无线智能物联网设备采用的自组织网络模式具有拓扑动态性、无中心分布性、无固定基础设施等特点,然而这些特点为通信与定位的安全性带来众多问题.首先,为实现无线智能设备的安全通信,往往采用单双钥加密相结合的方式,然而一旦设备密钥丢失或泄露,其密钥更新难以在自组织网络中及时同步;其次,在自组织网络中,多设备之间会话密钥的协商往往需要复杂的交互和运算;第三,在城市、野外等复杂环境下,采用自组织网络模式的智能设备难以接收来自外部足够强的定位信号,而现有的APS定位算法在缺乏基站等可信第三方基础设施情况下难以确保其定位安全性;最后,现有定位算法难以确保无线智能物联网设备所获得的定位信号未遭篡改,也难以保证网络监控下各移动设备所显示定位的真实性.针对上述问题,本系统将无线智能物联网设备之间建立的区块链作为可信基础设施,记录用户身份对应的密钥更新链,并便于多用户间会话密钥协商;基于共识机制实现在无定位信号或弱定位信号下物联网智能设备之间可信相互定位,并保障设备获取和发出的定位信息真实.本系统可使用现有安全的密码算法构建,能够高效安全地实现密钥更新与可信定位,适宜在实际物联网设备安全通信系统中使用.",作者关键词:blockchain; key update; key agreement; trusted positioning; ad hoc; Internet of Things (IOT),作者关键词:区块链; 密钥更新; 密钥协商; 可信定位; 自组网; 物联网

RFID adoption and its long-term impact on firm value: An empirical research based on global public companies,RFID信息技术采纳对上市公司的长期影响:基于全球视角的实证研究,2018,"In the era of the Internet of things (IoT), RFID is expected to take over barcode technology at a great rate. The technology has been developing rapidly and penetrating into people's daily life. This innovative technology can greatly lower manufacturing cost, reduce the uncertainty caused by information asymmetry, integrate the supply chain, and increase operational efficiency. However, some existing challenges, such as huge initial investment, integration problem, and performance uncertainties, make firms hesitate to undertake this innovative technology project. Empirical evidence on the trade-off between RFID benefit and cost in short term is not consistent. IT, like RFID, contributes to performance dimensions, such as strategic flexibility and intangible value. RFID's value cannot be fully realized in a short time and short-term analysis will not identify the impact of RFID adoption adequately. Thus, a long-term observation is needed to investigate RFID's impact. We use monthly data of 89 companies which adopted RFID projects around the world from January 1997 to December 2011. In addition, we perform four years calendar portfolio analysis (CPA) and ROA comparison analysis to gain insights into the mechanism of RFID for improving firm performance. A critique of the management literature on event studies using long-term windows is that other events will naturally occur as the time window expands and will confound the effect of the event under study. In response to this issue, calendar portfolio analysis is used in this study to discover RFID's long term impact on firms' market value. The calendar portfolio analysis is conducted in two steps. The first step computes an average return for the specified calendar-time portfolio. The second step measures the risk-adjusted performance by estimating a multifactor time-series regression model. Since the samples in our study are both US listed and non-US listed, we adopt the merged Fama-French three factors model proposed by Bose et al.'s study. The estimator of model intercept provides a test of the null hypothesis that the abnormal return of the portfolio on the calendar-time portfolio is zero. In addition, we find that firms adopting RFID generally experience significant and negative abnormal market return over a long term. However, single indicator alone has its prerequisite and its insufficiency. In this paper, we employ Return-on-Assets (ROA) as the second measure of firm performance and use ROA comparative analysis to gain insights into the mechanism of RFID for firm performance. We find that the adoption of RFID has influence on ROA of firms over a long term. Industry type is believed to be an essential moderator of IT investment. We follow Bose et al.'s research and classify our samples into manufacturing and nonmanufacturing samples to investigate industry factors that moderate the long-term impact of RFID on the investment return of adopting firms. We find that manufactures that adopt RFID have lower and significant negative abnormal market return, in comparison with non-manufacture adopters. RFID adoption has no significant positive influence on ROA for manufacturers and non-manufacturers. Our results show that RFID may be helpful, but increase operational cost to firms which could hurt their market value and may also cancel the effect of profit growth based on ROA. For managers of manufacturers, extra caution is needed if they want to adopt RFID because those firms may face additional risk due to heavy operational cost and challenges in integrating IT and business.","摘要:物联网时代,RFID技术迅速发展,其应用已经渗透到了人们工作与生活的各个领域。这种技术可以大大降低生产成本、降低信息不对称造成的不确定性、整合供应链资源、提升运营效率等,然而鉴于其初期投资成本巨大以及其他诸多安全问题,RFID信息采纳对公司市值的影响尚不明确,很多中小企业对于是否应用这项信息技术处于观望态度。本文以19972011年全球89家上市公司、119条RFID技术采纳信息披露公告为样本,采用国际会计准则通用的CPA(Calendar Portfolio Analysis)方法以及资产收益率ROA(Return on Assets)比较分析这些上市公司投资公告对企业长期的影响,并通过上市公司的分类考察RFID技术采纳的行业差异。本文发现总体上RFID技术对公司市值的长期影响仍不容乐观,其中RFID技术采纳对制造业企业冲击更为明显。在此基础上,本文提出了提升RFID采纳经营效果,保护外部投资者权益的相应建议。",作者关键词:RFID technology; Calendar portfolio analysis; ROA; Firm value,作者关键词:RFID技术; 日历组合分析法; 资产收益率; 公司市值

Relay Cooperative Secret Key Generation for Quasi-static Channels in Internet of Things,,2018,"A secret key generation scheme based on a cooperative relay is proposed to improve the generated secret key rate for quasi-static channels in Internet of things.

After that the relay employs network coding technique to participate the cooperation, and assists the two legitimate nodes to obtain the relay channels information. Finally, the two legitimate nodes agree on a secret key from the direct and relay channels information using the direct channel without the help of the relay.

Security Evaluation for Fault Attacks on Lightweight Block Cipher Midori,Midori算法抗故障攻击安全性评估,2017,"Midori is a lightweight block cipher of 128-bit key size proposed at ASIACRYPT 2015. It is a family of two block ciphers: Midori64 and Midori128 with 64-bit and 128-bit block size respectively, they can be used to protect small computing devices in IoT. The resistance of Midori64 and Midori128 against fault attacks is evaluated. Firstly, the remained key entropy of Midori is evaluated by analyzing the fault propagation path based on information theory. Theoretical analysis results show that: based on half byte and full byte fault model in round R-3, one fault injection can reduce the key entropy of Midori64 and Midori128 to 68.47 and 8.03 bits, respectively. However, the computation complexity in analyzing faults in round R-2 to round R-3 is unaffordable and multiple fault injections can solve this problem. Then, the remained key entropy of Midori is verified by differential fault analysis (DFA) technique. The result demonstrates that: three random half byte fault injections can reduce the key entropy of Midori64 to 8.10 bits and two random byte fault injections can recover the full secret key of Midori128. Finally, an algebraic technique is introduced into fault attack on Midori and an algebraic fault analysis (AFA) is applied to optimize the DFA result. The results show that: AFA can extend fault attack on Midori64 to more complicated fault models. Based on the byte fault model in round R-3 and half byte fault model in round R-4, four and ten fault injections can recover the full 128-bit key of Midori64, respectively. Based on the byte fault model in round R-3, single fault injection can reduce the key entropy of Midori128 to less than 16-bit for 94% of the cases. Thus, the last 5 rounds of Midori should be protected against fault attacks.","摘要:Midori是ASIACRYPT 2015上提出的一种轻量级分组密码算法,密钥长度为128-bit,分组长度为64/128-bit,分别对应Midori64和Midori128,可被用于保护物联网设备安全.对Midori算法抗故障分析安全性进行了评估.首先,基于信息论通过分析故障传播路径,对故障注入后的Midori密钥剩余熵进行了理论估计.结果表明:基于第R-3轮半字节和字节模型, 1次故障注入可分别将Midori64、Midori128密钥剩余熵大约降低到68.47-bit、8.03-bit,但对倒数第2轮、第3轮故障分析复杂度较高,多次故障注入分析可解决该问题.然后,利用差分故障分析方法,对故障注入后的Midori密钥剩余熵进行了实际验证.结果表明: 3次随机半字节、2次随机字节故障可分别将Midori64、Midori128的密钥剩余熵降低至8.10-bit和0-bit.最后,利用Midori代数方程简单特点,将代数分析引入到故障分析中,利用代数故障分析方法优化了Midori差分故障分析结果.结果表明:代数故障分析可将Midori64故障攻击扩展到复杂故障模型,基于第R-3轮字节故障模型、R-4轮半字节故障模型,可分别使用4次、10次故障注入恢复Midori64完整密钥;代数故障分析可以降低Midori128攻击复杂度,基于第R-3轮字节故障模型, 1次故障注入在94%的情况下可将Midori128密钥熵降低至16-bit以内.因此,必须对Midori算法倒数5轮进行故障攻击防护.",作者关键词:Midori; lightweight block cipher; Midori; differential fault analysis; algebraic fault analysis; security evaluation,作者关键词:轻量级分组密码; 差分故障分析; 代数故障分析; 安全性评估

Data assimilation is a new technology to combine the numerical modelling with observation, which is able to improve the accuracy of model output by incorporating the observations into numerical model to update the model states and correct the model parameters. In this study,Particle Filter (PF),a sequential Monte Carlo data assimilation algorithm,is employed to combine the numerical hydrodynamic-sediment-phosphorus model with phosphorus observations to develop a data assimilation system to improve the estimation of phosphorus concentration in rivers. When the phosphorus observation becomes available,the model state variable,phosphorus concentration,will be updated and the model parameter, partition coefficient K_d, will be corrected according to the PF theory. The developed data assimilation system is applied to the Changjiang River segment from Cuntan to Three Gorges Dam to evaluate its performance of estimating phosphorus transport in a real event. The results show that the developed data assimilation system can update phosphorus concentrations and correct K_d effectively and dynamically at the assimilation time. After assimilation,the accuracy of estimation of phosphorus transport can be enhanced significantly due to the effect of assimilation, indicating the developed data assimilation system has a good performance in the real event.","摘要:通过磷迁移数学模型合理估计磷在河流中的时空分布,对防治水体富营养化,抑制水华暴发具有重要的科学和工程意义。数据同化方法可以将模型和观测两种研究手段有机地结合起来,将观测数据融入模型,优化模型状态变量,校正模型参数,进而提高数学模型的模拟预报精度,并依托物联网技术将传统数学模型发展为实时数学模型。本文将粒子滤波数据同化算法引入到水动力-泥沙-磷迁移模型中,以实测的断面磷含量作为观测数据,在观测时刻优化磷含量估计结果,同时校正模型参数磷相平衡分配系数K_d,构建了水动力-泥沙-磷迁移模型同化系统。将其应用于长江上游寸滩至坝前河段的计算结果表明,所构建的同化系统在真实的河流中计算效果良好,可以有效地优化更新状态变量各相磷含量浓度,并反演出模型参数K_d随水沙水环境条件变化的动态变化过程,同化之后模型模拟预报磷输移过程的精度显著提升,为水质实时模型打下基础。",作者关键词:river sediment; phosphorus transport; particle filter; data assimilation; Internet of things,作者关键词:河流泥沙; 磷迁移; 粒子滤波; 数据同化; 物联网

Designing and Validation of the Remote Monitoring System for Pigs Survival Based on IoT Technology,基于物联网技术的生猪存亡远程监测系统设计与验证,2017,"【Objective】 At present, currently the governments supervision of pigs still remains in the passive supervision of label type ear, but due to the leg of supervision, the malignant event that died pigs were discarded often occurs. In order to solve the difficult problems of the remote supervision of the state of survival of pigs for regulatory authorities and facilitate the breeding enterprises to monitor the pig heart rate so that the pigs with abnormal heart rate can be treated timely by using intervention measures. A set of remote monitoring system which can collect the data of pig heart rate and judge the pigs state of life or death was designed in this paper. 【Method】 The system uses the wireless sensor network architecture which consists of smart tag, routing nodes, gateway, remote server, monitoring center for pig farms and monitoring center for regulators. The data from smart tag is transferred with Wireless ZigBee network via routing node, and the GPRS module in the gateway will transfer the data through the Internet to a remote server. Once an exception in data occurs, software system will alarm automatically. Taking the program of wearable heart rate monitoring for reference, the paper uses photoelectric heart rate measuring method which uses LED and optical sensors, and combines with filter circuit and amplifier circuit to design the heart rate sensor. In order to know the wavelength of LED and the inducted wavelengths of light sensors, the research collects blood samples at different weight of Du pig ears, and uses the Ron Bo Bills law to research the spectral absorbance rule of the HbO_2 in the blood of pigs and the hemoglobin in order to design the sensor of heart rate and analyze the reason why the heart rate sensor is not accurate in the motion state. The research also combines with the pigs sleeping habits to use DMP (Digital Motion Processor) of the attitude sensor MPU6050 to get the stable posture data and identify the inaccurate data. Finally, the research uses CC2530 carried with ZigBee Protocol to achieve the data reading from the heart rate sensor and MPU6050 through the ADC converters and I/O simulation IIC communication protocol. Meantime, the research transfers the data by the ZigBee network and turns on the mode PM2 to reduce power consumption. All these make the pig ear tag integrated the monitoring of the heart rate and attitude.【Result】Taking into account of the factors such as the cost of electronic components, the general rate and impact on pig lives, from the spectral absorbance law of HbO_2 and Hb, the result shows that the 560 nm light used to measure the effect of the heart rate of the pig is effective. Compared to the traditional manual measurement, the measuring error of the pig heart rate sensor with the wavelength is just 0.9%. Because the lying sleeping time of the pigs accounts for more than 75% and they usually take basic activities before and after eating, the heart rate sensor can test the pigs for a long time especially using MPU6050 to monitor the movement of live pigs. Consequently, the system developed in this paper can realize the monitoring of heart rate under the static state and the attitude in the motion state and pigs died if there is no data in the static state. 【Conclusion】Because of its light weight, small volume, low power consumption and accurate measurement, the pig ear tag can realize the monitoring of pigs in the static state and the motion state, thus realized the monitoring of the pigs survival condition and the long-term monitoring of pig heart rate. This changed the passive monitoring mode of traditional RFID ear tags and is of great significance for the supervision of government and the living welfare of pigs.","摘要:【目的】当前政府对生猪的监管停留在标签式耳标的被动监管上,但由于监管滞后经常出现死猪被丢弃的恶性事件发生,为了解决监管部门对生猪存亡状态远程监管难的问题,同时便于养殖企业监测生猪的心率,对异常心率的生猪及时采取有效措施。笔者设计一种集生猪心率采集及生猪存亡判断的远程监测系统。【方法】系统采用无线传感网的数据传输架构模式,由智能耳标、路由节点、网关、远程服务器、猪场监测中心、政府监管部门监测中心组成。智能耳标采集数据通过无线ZigBee网络经路由节点,由网关中的GPRS模块将数据经由Internet转发至远程服务器中,软件系统自动对数据异常生猪报警。参考人用穿戴式心率监测的设计,采用光电心率测量法,使用LED及光感应器,结合滤波电路、放大电路设计了心率传感器。同时为确定LED的发光波长及光感应器的感应波长,通过采集不同体重杜长大猪耳处血液样本,运用郎伯比尔定律,利用分光光度计研究生猪血液中(HbO_2)与脱氧血红蛋白(Hb)对光谱吸光度规律,从光电心率测量法的原理出发,分析心率传感器在运动状态下测量不精确的原因。此外结合生猪的睡眠习性利用姿态传感器MPU6050中的DMP(Digital Motion Processor)获取稳定的姿态数据,并识别心率传感器采集的不准确的数据。最后采用具有ZigBee协议的CC2530通过自带的ADC转换器、I/O模拟IIC通信协议实现心率传感器、MPU6050的数据读取,并通过ZigBee网络进行数据传输,用其PM2(睡眠)模式降低功耗,制成集心率与姿态的监测为一体的耳标佩戴在猪耳上。【结果】研究表明从HbO_2与Hb对光谱吸光度规律观测,同时考虑到电子元件的成本、通用率,对生猪生活影响等因素,560 nm光用于生猪光电式心率测量效果明显。生猪心率传感器采用该波长光对生猪心率测量与传统人工测量方法对比,心率误差为0.9%,由于生猪卧睡时间占75%以上并且基本只在进食前后活动,因此心率传感器可较长时间对生猪进行监测,尤其是利用MPU6050监测运动情况,故该系统可实现对生猪静态下进行心率监测、动态下进行姿态监测,当在静态下无心率数据则代表生猪死亡。【结论】由于该耳标质量轻、体积小、功耗低、测量准确,可以较为便利地实现在静态下对生猪进行心率监测和动态下的姿态监测,即实现了生猪存亡状态监测的同时,也实现了对生猪心率的长期监测。改变了传统RFID耳标的被动监测模式,对改善生猪的福利水平及提高政府的监管能力具有重要意义。",作者关键词:CC2530; pig heart rate; posture; pig habits; CC2530; intelligent ear tag,作者关键词:生猪心率; 姿态; 生猪习性; 智能耳标

The user can accord to the requirement for personalized and customized service life. However, smart home systems appear conflicts between rules frequently, because the number of rules is becoming more and more. Therefore, this paper proposes EasiRCC, a new-type method of rapid rule-matching and conflict resolution. Resolving the conflict problem mainly focuses on rule-matching and conflict resolution. Firstly, for the problem of rule-matching, because repeating matching takes place in the existing methods frequently, we propose an algorithm named EasiRMA, which is used to fast match rule based on Hash function and raise the efficiency of rule-matching. Secondly, for the problem of conflict resolution, we come up with a scheduling mechanism of mixed-priority, which the system can adaptively adjust priority of rules, and resolve rule-conflict in time. Experimental results show that EasiRCC's efficiency of rule-matching is not changing as the number of rules is increased, and its running time is constant, but the running time of traditional matching method is O(N), and EasiRCC can effectively resolve conflict in the condition that does not affect users' normal household lives.","摘要:在智能家居中,规则间的冲突问题会直接影响系统的稳定性,针对智能家居的规则冲突问题,提出了一种新型的快速规则匹配和冲突消除方法EasiRCC.解决冲突问题,首先要解决规则的匹配问题,现有的规则匹配方法频发重复匹配现象,造成了系统资源的浪费,针对规则的重复匹配问题,提出了一种基于散列函数寻址方式的快速规则匹配算法EasiRMA,提高了规则匹配效率.其次要解决冲突的消除问题,现有的方法都是采用固定优先级方法来消除冲突,但是却增加了用户制定规则的复杂度,因此提出了一种混合优先级调度机制,使系统可以实时地自适应调整规则的执行优先级.实验结果显示:EasiRCC的规则匹配效率不会随着规则数的增多而变化,其时间复杂度为常数,而传统的匹配方法为O(N),并且在不影响用户正常家居生活的前提下,能够有效地消除规则冲突.",作者关键词:Internet of things; smart home; rule-matching; Hash function; conflict resolution; mixed-priority,作者关键词:物联网; 智能家居; 规则匹配; 散列函数; 冲突消除; 混合优先级
Strongly Secure Anonymous Implicit Authentication and Key Agreement for Roaming Service,强安全的匿名隐式漫游认证与密钥协商方案,2017,"The existing two-party authentication and key agreement protocols for roaming service are provably secure in the CK model, and do not resist the attack of ephemeral secrets reveal. Based on elliptic curve cryptography and identity-based cryptosystem, we propose an anonymous two-party authentication and key agreement scheme for roaming service. The new scheme, based on the Schnorr signature, achieves mutual implicit authentication by a well designed ""challenge-response"" signature which is similar to the one in the HMQV protocol. We extend the ID-BJM model, a widely used security model for analyzing identity-based authenticated key agreement protocols, to simulate two-party authentication and key agreement schemes for roaming service. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the new scheme is eCK secure under the extended ID-BJM model, and that the security of the new scheme can be reduced to solve (by a polynomial-time adversary) computational Diffie- Hellman problems on an elliptic curve over finite fields. Comparative analysis shows that the new scheme has stronger security, achieves resistant to ephemeral secrets reveal, needs fewer cryptography libraries, and has lower computing, communication and storage overheads.

Disease and insect pest forecasting model of greenhouse winter jujube based on modified deep belief network,基于改进深度置信网络的大棚冬枣病虫害预测模型,2017,"The diseases and insect pests of greenhouse winter jujube are one of the main factors that restrict the yield and quality of winter jujube. The timely prediction of the jujube diseases and insect pests is the prerequisite to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. It is difficult to establish an accurate forecasting model of diseases and insect pests using traditional mathematical method and neural network (NN) because of many complex factors that lead to the occurrence of diseases and insect pests of winter jujube, including the meteorological conditions (such as temperature, sunlight, humidity), soil conditions (such as moisture, soil heavy metals), and biological characteristics (such as roots, leaves). During the process of forecasting model training, due to the defects of artificial design features and the unpredictable complexity in the design process, the accuracy of disease and insect pest prediction and the efficiency of the design features can't have a lot of space of ascension. It is possible to automatically forecast diseases and insect pests of winter jujube with the development of agricultural IOT (Internet of Things), smart camera equipment, high performance and large capacity data storage, computer and network technology as well as the massive complex data processing technology. Faced with the problem of complexity and uncertainty of diseases and insect pests prediction of winter jujube, a forecasting model of winter jujube diseases and insect pests is proposed based on the modified deep belief network (DBN). Due to the merits of the DBN, the prediction model of disease and insect pest based on modified DBN can not only utilize 20 kinds of environmental information data, but also introduce the similarity between the prior information and the constraints of the current information. The modified DBN consists of a visible input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. The visible layer inputs the data, whose range has been normalized into [0,1]; the hidden layers are invisible, in which binary values are used, and activated by the sigmoid kernel function. Via simulating neural connecting structure of human brain and introducing the supervised information by restricting the similarity between feature vectors in the learning process, the proposed model can automatically learn senior nonlinear hierarchical combination features from the environmental information of winter jujube growth, which is suitable for data classification and importing high-level features into traditional BP (back propagation) neural network classifier to improve the disease forecasting precision. The disease and insect pest prediction is conducted by BP network in the top level of DBN. Experiments on the actual database of disease and insect pest of greenhouse winter jujube are performed. After a large number of training samples and training times, the prediction accuracy rate of diseases and insect pests is greatly improved. The accuracy rate of forecasting result is over than 84%. The experimental results show that the proposed model has provided a technical basis and support for the automatic crop disease forecasting with environmental information obtained in fields, and has great application prospect in disease and insect pest prediction of greenhouse winter jujube. As there are many factors affecting crop diseases, practically, some factors vary with the time, how to use the environmental information of crop growth to build a powerful and practical crop disease forecasting method still needs further study.","摘要:导致冬枣病虫害发生的原因很多而且很复杂,利用传统的数学方法和神经网络(neural network, NN)很难建立正确的病虫害预测模型。由于典型的深度置信网络(deep belief network, DBN)的各层之间缺乏有监督训练,使得网络误差逐层向上传递,降低了预测模型的预测率。针对这些问题,引入冬枣病虫害的先验信息,提出一种基于环境信息和改进DBN的冬枣病虫害预测模型。在该模型中,通过无监督训练和有监督微调从冬枣生长的环境信息序列中获取可表征冬枣病虫害发生的深层特征的隐层参数,并形成新的特征集,然后在预测模型的顶层通过一个后向传播神经网络(back propagation neural network, BPNN)进行病虫害预测。从20142017年的4 a时间内,利用农业物联网传感器采集30个大棚冬枣常见的2种虫害和3种病害发生的环境信息序列6 000多条,由此验证所提出的预测模型,平均预测正确率高达84.05%。与基于强模糊支持向量机、改进型NN和BPNN的3种病虫害预测模型进行了试验比较,预测正确率提高了20多个百分点。试验结果表明,该模型极大提高了大棚冬枣病虫害的预测正确率。该研究可为大棚冬枣病虫害预测提供技术参考。",作者关键词:diseases; forecasting; models; environmental information of winter jujube growth; insect pests; deep belief network (DBN); modified DBN,作者关键词:病害; 预测; 模型; 冬枣生长环境信息; 虫害; 深度置信网络; 改进深度置信网络

The impact of Cloud Computing and Big Data on the future trends of seismic exploration,云计算与大数据及其对勘探地震技术发展的影响,2017,"Oil and gas exploration is one of the riskiest and most expensive of all commercial endeavors. Exploring for these oil and gas reservoirs is done by generating enormous amounts of seismic data and running that data through the computational ringer to reveal the most promising locations to drill. Data sets in this domain are among the largest in the industry, reaching into multiple petabytes, and which must be funneled from the storage subsystem to the compute nodes at tens of gigabytes per second. Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies describe a new generation of technologies and architectures designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data (structured and unstructured) by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery as well as analysis. These technologies have made remarkable success in some traditional business areas. However, in the field of seismic exploration, the potential of Cloud Computing and Big Data technology has not yet been fully emancipated. There are many challenges. Data are locked in applications and cannot be shared efficiently. Data sets of this size compel the storage resources and network bandwidth. The processing workloads are a great challenge to the computing infrastructure and costs. Jobs may be random or sequential or both in an unpredictable pattern. Automatic or semi-automatic extraction of useful information for interpretation and visualization of seismic images is still unpractical. Furthermore, the workflow of oil exploration has formed into a processing chain, i.e. the output from one job becomes the input for another, covering from acquisition, processing to interpretation and visualization, which means that a software ecosystem is needed so that the newly acquired seismic data could be processed in real time to cope with the time demands and the workflow flexibility. To address those topics, this paper introduces the methodology and basic features of Cloud Computing and Big Data, analyzes the relationship between cloud computing, big data and Internet of Things, Internet + as well as other key technologies. Several existing Cloud Computing and Big Data systems are introduced. Furthermore, the technical characteristics of seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation are analyzed. The presented evidence shows that the integration of acquisition, processing, interpretation and visualization has been the trend of the seismic exploration. The paper then discusses the influence of Cloud Computing and Big Data on the evolution of seismic technology in three aspects. MapReduce framework as well as some success applications is presented to verify that Cloud Computing could handle the processing of tremendous huge and complex seismic data. Machine learning based on cloud computing is becoming a prosperous solution for seismic analysis to automatically extract more value from data. And the combination of Internet Things and Big Data is a good choice for seismic acquisition. Finally, the paper points out that building a software ecosystem of seismic processing and improving the technologies of seismic acquisition based on internet of things is the right choice to fully realize digital seismic exploration.","摘要:互联网技术发展至今,已进入了大数据和云计算时代,并在传统商业领域取得了令人瞩目的成功,产生了许多新的发展模式.但是,在勘探地震专业领域, 云计算与大数据技术的潜力尚没有充分发挥.本文介绍了云计算与大数据的方法论和基本特征,分析了云计算、大数据和物联网、互联网+等关键技术之间的关系,并结合地震采集、处理、解释的技术特点和发展需求,探讨了云计算与大数据对地震技术发展的影响,提出了建设地震专业软件生态系统和基于物联网改变地震采集现状的设想.",作者关键词:seismic exploration; Big Data; Cloud Computing; internet of things; internet+,作者关键词:勘探地震技术; 大数据; 云计算; 物联网; 互联网+

Design and implementation on real-time monitoring system of laying hens environmental comfort based on LabVIEW,基于LabVIEW平台的蛋鸡舍环境舒适度实时监测系统设计与实现,2017,"Living in a comfortable environment during the period of egg production will enable laying hens to achieve their genetic potential. With the development of the poultry industry to larger scale, the air quality in laying house has become the most important factor affecting the health level and production performance of laying hens. Because of the complexity of environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and concentration of CO_2 and NH_3, it is difficult to describe the level of the environmental comfort quantitatively. In this study, the real-time system of monitoring environment comfort for laying hens was established by the following methods. Firstly, the comfort thresholds of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and concentration of CO_2 and NH_3 for laying hens were established respectively by investigating relevant references. The results showed that the temperatures for comfortable zone (CZ), less comfortable zone (LCZ) and uncomfortable zone (UZ) were 18-21 ℃, 13-18 or 21-26 ℃, and <5 ℃ or >30 ℃ respectively. As for the RH, the temperatures for these 3 zones were 60%-70%, 40%-60% or 70%-72%, and <40% or >72% respectively. The ranges of wind speed for CZ, LCZ and UZ in winter were 0.1-0.2 m/s, 0-0.1 or 0.2-0.25 m/s and >0.25 m/s respectively, and in summer were 0.5-1.5 m/s, 0.25-0.5 or 1.5-2.5 m/s and <0.25 or >2.5 m/s respectively. And the concentrations of CO_2 for these 3 zones were <1 500, 1 500-4 000, and >4 000 mg/m~3 respectively; the concentrations of NH_3 were <15, 15-20, and >25 mg/m~3, respectively. Secondly, the theory of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was used for data fusion of the environment factors, and AHP (analytic hierarchy process) was applied to determine the weight of the environment factors in winter and summer. The results showed that the weight set of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, concentration of CO_2 and NH_3 in winter was 0.428 6, 0.151 1, 0.049 5, 0.282 8, and 0.087 9, respectively, and in summer was 0.432 6, 0.241 8, 0.102 9, 0.081 3, and 0.141 4, respectively. Thirdly, a real-time data collection and analysis system of laying house environment was built through the LabVIEW platform, and the real-time environmental comfort evaluation was presented in this system. Lastly, a new method named comfort time proportion method was developed to collect the statistic data of environmental comfort during feeding period. On the basis of the platform of Agricultural Internet constructed by Key Laboratory of Agriculture Engineering in Structure and Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, the laying houses in the Huangshan Deqingyuan Poultry company and in the Shangzhuang Experimental Station of China Agricultural University were selected as the environmental data acquisition node, and then the real-time monitoring system of environmental comfort for laying hens was tested and verified. Compared with the single environment factor, the system can reflect the environmental comfort of the house more comprehensively. And the environment comfort of the laying house in Deqingyuan was better than that in Shangzhuang Experimental Station in winter. The outcomes of this paper will be helpful for evaluating the environment comfort for laying hens.","摘要:蛋鸡的环境舒适度是多种因素相互作用的结果,其状况的好坏难以用数值来描述。该研究以蛋鸡为主体,通过文献资料确定影响蛋鸡舍舒适度的各环境因素的阈值,利用模糊数学理论对各环境因素数据进行融合,得到蛋鸡环境舒适评价结果,采用LabVIEW搭建蛋鸡舍环境舒适度实时监测系统,输出实时的环境舒适度评价结果,利用舒适度时间占比法对饲养周期内的数据进行分析。在实验室畜禽物联网平台的基础上,选取黄山德青源种禽有限公司试验鸡舍和中国农业大学上庄实验站试验鸡舍作为系统环境数据获取节点,对系统进行验证。结果显示:采用层次分析法得到冬季鸡舍环境因素(温度、湿度、风速、二氧化碳浓度和氨气浓度)的权重集W_冬={0.4286,0.1511,0.0495,0.2828,0.0879},夏季为W_夏= {0.4326,0.2418,0.1029,0.0813,0.1414};与采用单一环境因素对舍内环境进行评价相比,系统能较全面的反映出舍内的舒适程度;冬季黄山德青源种禽有限公司试验鸡舍环境舒适度要好于中国农业大学上庄实验站试验鸡舍。该研究为蛋鸡舍内综合环境评价提供了一种新的方法,同时也为畜禽物联网实时监测数据的应用提供了一种新的思路。",作者关键词:LabVIEW; monitoring; temperature; humidity; laying hens house; environmental comfort; LabVIEW; internet of things,作者关键词:监测; 温度; 湿度; 蛋鸡舍; 环境舒适度; 物联网

A Secure Mutual Authentication Protocol Based on SRAM PUF,一种基于SRAM PUF的安全双向认证协议,2017,"In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of devices will be connected over the Internet. While it provides convenience to access these devices, these devices with limited resource are exposed to malicious adversaries. In order to defend against attacks, data encryption and access control techniques are essential countermeasures. Key storage and authentication are critical to security of the IoT devices. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a kind of hardware security component based on the uncontrollable random variants during manufacture. Every PUF response is unique and unclonable physically. The common applications of PUF are key storage and authentication. SRAM PUF is a kind of PUF which uses the initial value of ubiquitous SRAM after powered up as PUF response. Because of the manufacturing variants, the balanced transistors designed in one cell cannot be made identical in another. There are some subtle differences between them. So the initial value after powered up may not be equal. Additionally, the random noise of environment can cause the initial value of one SRAM to be different. There is some randomness between these values. Most mutual authentication protocols used widely are fragile to side channel analysis because the symmetric key of a block cipher to operate on random is a fixed value. This paper presents an enhanced mutual authentication protocol based on SRAM PUF which generates a random key of block cipher used in the common protocol. Side channel analysis will be infeasible on a random symmetric key. Significant improvement on protocol security is present with only a little extra resource. So the new protocol is suitable for lightweight devices with limited resources.","摘要:物联网时代,海量的各种设备通过网络相互连接,在带来了方便的同时,也把这些资源有限的设备暴露在攻击者的面前.为了对抗攻击,数据加密和访问控制是必不可少的防护措施,因此密钥存储和身份认证就成为关键点.物理不可克隆函数(Physical Unclonable Function, PUF)是一种硬件安全组件,它基于芯片制造过程中的随机偏差,使得每个PUF具有唯一性并且物理不可克隆,它的常见应用是密钥存储和身份认证.SRAM PUF是利用芯片中广泛存在的SRAM作为PUF,由于制造的随机偏差使得 SRAM的cell中,设计上对称的晶体管,实际上却存在微小的差异,最终表现在不同的SRAM上电初始值完全不同.由于环境噪声的影响,同一个SRAM上电初始值不完全相同,呈现出一定的随机性.目前通用的双向认证协议中,使用对称加密算法加密随机数来实现,加密的密钥是固定的,存在被侧信道分析获得的风险.本文提出一种基于SRAM PUF的双向认证协议,在原有的协议基础上,使用认证双方能够一致获得的随机密钥,这样使得侧信道分析不再有效,只增加了很小的开销就可以明显提升安全性,非常适合于资源有限的轻量级设备.",作者关键词:SRAM PUF; SRAM PUF; mutual authentication protocol,作者关键词:双向认证协议

Stacked Auto-Encoder Optimized Emotion Recognition in Multimodal Wearable Biosensor Network,面向可穿戴多模生物信息传感网络的栈式自编码器优化情绪识别,2017,"Emotional health draws great concern with the enhancement of public health consciousness.Emotional health is closely related to the quality of personal life.Even for some special groups of people,like pilots,soldiers,etc.,their emotional states will have impacts on the stability of communities.Traditionally,to evaluate emotional states of human beings relies on the doctors or psychologists to communicate with subjects and give scores based on various questionnaires. This approach is not scientific enough and leads to the difficulties in the emotional health monitoring in daily-life.Emotion recognition enables lifeless sensors and computers to measure and interpret human emotions.It is a procedure consisting of emotion-related bio signals recording, features extraction and emotional states classification,providing scientific evidence for emotional health monitoring and primary diagnosis of potential mental diseases.In the related works concerning emotion recognition,the application scenarios are usually restricted in the hospitals or labs and the common-used classifiers are not suitable for the daily emotion recognition data set. This paper develops a multimodal biosensor network to simplify the sensing framework so that it can finish emotion recognition tasks when subjects are participating in daily tasks without so many disturbances.Several wearable biosensor nodes record multimodal bio signals(electroencephalography, pulse and blood pressure)and transmit them to a body station employing Arduino UNO3and its expansion boards.The body station works as a web client connecting to a web data center on the Internet by wireless routers or personal hotspots.The web data center is established on NI-PXI 1065with a static public IP address.The recognition algorithm is carried out in the data center and the results are displayed for authorized web terminals with the assistance of web publishing service supported by LabVIEW.The multimodal wearable biosensor network can provide emotion-related bio signals from which typical features are extracted based on the existing theories.In particular,due to the uncertainties in signal acquisition and feature extraction,a stacked auto-encoder(based on the deep learning theory)optimized emotion recognition method is proposed to improve the recognition process.The stacked auto-encoder helps to pre-learn the feature vectors and with the fine tuning it generates a better scheme for emotion classification phase.There are 9emotional states for classification according to the Valence-Arousal dimensional model.A two-layer stacked neural network with a soft_(max) classifier is designed to finish the final classification tasks.The experiment convinces that the feature vectors pre-learned by stacked auto-encoder are of higher quality both in centrality and distinguishability based on the similarity evaluation theory.The final recognition rate is also improved approximately 5% compared to related works.The main contributions of this paper are the wearable network-based sensing structure,the stacked auto-encoder optimized multimodal emotion recognition algorithm and the quantitative analysis on 71-day experimental data.This is a novel system for daily emotional health monitoring and can provide scientific suggestions for doctors or guardians.

Data Gathering Based on Regionalized Compressive Sensing in WSN,基于区域化压缩感知的无线传感器网络数据收集方法,2017,"On the basis of traditional transmission methods in wireless sensor networks,a vital problem is that a center region near the sink will be created and the sensors in it require vast energy to receive or relay data packages from other sensors.In this case,their own energy will rapidly be exhausted.Recently,compressive sensing(CS)has been employed to reduce the number of data transmissions and extend the lifetime of networks.This paper proposes an energy-efficient data gathering approach based on regionalized compressive sensing (RCS).Firstly,the network is randomly divided into smaller regions without the requirement for any specific relationships or features among sensors in the same block.Subsequently,a center sensor for each region is elected and is utilized to receive original readings of all other sensors in its region.Furthermore,CS is implemented on each center sensor in individual region respectively.The regional measurement matrix is given to generate regionalized samplings.Finally,the regional measurements in every region are transported to the sink for reconstruction.To further guarantee the viability of our approach,two issues related to practical applications are considered:(1)how to design an available regional measurement matrix,and (2)when the sampling procedure should be terminated. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed RCS outperforms the existing methods in terms of efficiency,and the feasibility of the two issues in practice is also verified.","摘要:在无线传感器网络的数据收集过程中,传统的传输方式会使靠近Sink节点的中继节点接收和发送大量数据,形成一个以Sink节点为中心的区域.相对于其他节点来说,该区域内传感器的能量会更快地被耗尽,导致整个网络负载不均衡.目前,压缩感知(Compressive Sensing,CS)已经逐步应用于无线传感器网络领域用以减少传感器的传输量,以达到延长网络生命周期的目的.为实现能量有效的传输,该文提出一种基于区域化压缩感知(Regionalized Compressive Sensing,RCS)的数据收集方法.首先,网络拓扑被随机划分成多个区域,划分原则不依赖于所采集数据的特征或相关性;然后,每个区域选择选出一个区域中心节点以接收其他节点的采样值;随后,区域中心节点使用CS方法获得区域测量值;最后,这些节点将它们发送到Sink节点用于数据重构.为保证RCS的有效性,该文进一步考虑了实际应用中的两个问题,区域测量矩阵的设计和采样停止时机的选择.通过与当前典型的传输方法比较,RCS方法的性能优于直接传输、分布式压缩感知以及混合算法,同时实验验证了所提出的区域测量矩阵设计原则和采样停止原则是可行的.",作者关键词:compressive sensing; regionalized compressive sensing; data gathering; wireless sensor network; Internet of Things; Cyber-Physical System,作者关键词:压缩感知; 区域化压缩感知; 数据收集; 无线传感器网络; 物联网
Vector Task Map:Progressive Task Allocation in Crowd-Sensing,矢量任务地图:群智感知任务渐进式分发方法,2017,"With integrated sensors increasing in mobile terminals,terminal users can participate in crowd-sensing as sensing units.The first step towards crowd-sensing is to allocate tasks to terminals.Task allocation in crowd-sensing differs from that in common sensor networks because mobile terminals move disorderly and hardware devices are varied to different terminals.Among the existed methods in crowd-sensing task allocation,sensing server needs to allocate task in real time or makes mobility model of terminals.A new system called Vector Task Map is proposed. This system can work without sensing server.Terminals can be divided into groups and sense environment autonomously after receiving the Vector Task Map.The Vector Task Map combines sub-roads with task information because position of sensing task is fixed and terminal users always move along the road.Most sub-roads are non-furcation part of normal road.Some sub-roads are made by a few of coordinate points if tasks can not combine any real roads.Therefore, Vector Task Map can set tasks over the geographic region in a fine-grained way.Two methods are implemented alternately to allocate Vector Task Map progressively.One is improving map resolution and the other is increasing the number of points on each sub-road.We allocated more precise point coordinate by bit to improve map resolution.We used'ZeroThreshold'Douglas-Peucker algorithm to add points.In'ZeroThreshold'Douglas-Peucker algorithm,only coordinate point that is out of all existing lines can be added.Meanwhile,we proposed'Add-Point Coordinate Compression'algorithm to save map data.Because of add-point locating out of existing line in current resolution map and within line in previous low resolution,we can speculate the coordinate of add-point.This paper simulated terminals'movement by MATLAB.The allocation effect of the Vector Task Map is measured by the rate of sub-roads that mobile terminals locate in.The success rate of allocation is above 60% when the number of mobile terminals is equal to that of tasks.The success rate is above 85% when the number of mobile terminals is twice as many as tasks.Moreover,the success rate has a room for further improvement with increasing measured interval.Because of low map resolution or a handful of coordinate points on sub-roads, one coordinate may contain multiple tasks in Vector Task Map.This impacts task-group division. We defined this situation as an error rate.At resolution 1024*1024,error rate of the Vector Task Map is nearly 0%.In terms of data size,progressive task allocation is smaller than direct task allocation.During progressive task allocation,the number of new coordinate points adapts to map resolution improving,too.Meanwhile,the time of decoding Vector Task Map is less than 0.5second in terminal.Comparing with Zoom in same resolution,the data size of Vector Task Map is always smaller than 30%.","摘要:伴随着越来越多的传感器被集成到移动终端,群智感知逐渐成为可能.群智感知的第一步是传感任务的分发,由于移动终端具有移动性,且拥有多样化的硬件设备与感知能力,因而群智感知任务分发不同于普通的传感任务分发.考虑到感知任务的位置固定且节点移动往往基于道路,因而将子道路和任务绑定在一起,设计出基于矢量任务地图的任务分发方法.子道路可以是完整道路中无分叉的一小段道路,也可以由某几个坐标点组成,满足不同覆盖范围的任务.节点接收到任务地图后,由位于相同道路并能够测量该道路上所要求传感任务的移动节点组成传感组,彼此协调完成任务测量.交替进行两种方法实现矢量任务地图的渐进式分发:(1)提高地图分辨率; (2)增加子道路上坐标点数目.通过坐标点精度按位增加的方法提高地图分辨率;通过零阈值Douglas-Peucker算法增加子道路上坐标点的数目.同时,设计新增点坐标信息压缩算法节约矢量任务地图的数据量,其利用新增点在前一低分辨率地图中位于已有点连线上、在当前分辨率地图中位于已有点连线外这一特点,推测新增点的坐标信息.在MATLAB中的模拟实验表明,当矢量任务地图分发给与任务数量相同的移动节点时,任务分发的成功率达到60%以上;当分发给任务数量两倍的移动节点时,任务分发的成功率达到85%以上.同时,采用渐进式分发方法比直接分发更节约数据量且道路坐标点数目的增加与分辨率增加相适应.最后与Zoom进行比较,本文设计的矢量任务地图在1024*1024分辨率下错测量接近0%,且数据量比Zoom降低30%.",作者关键词:crowd-sensing; task allocation; progressive transmission; vector task map; data compression; Internet of Things; Cyber-Physical System,作者关键词:群智感知; 任务分发; 渐进式; 矢量地图; 数据压缩; 物联网; 信息物理融合系统

The Implementation and Optimization of Lightweight Block Cipher RECTANGLE based on FELICS,轻量级分组密码RECTANGLE基于FELICS的实现与优化,2017,"With the popularization of Internet of Things (IOT) and the wide application of RFID and sensors, more attention is being paid to lightweight ciphers. Besides security, the software and hardware performance are also important for a lightweight cipher. The researchers in University of Luxembourg developed an open-source frameworkFELICS (Fair Evaluation of Lightweight Cryptographic Systems) in 2015, which aims at fairly evaluating the software performance of lightweight ciphers on embedded devices. By extracting Flash, RAM consumption and execution time on three widely used microcontrollers: 8-bit AVR, 16-bit MSP and 32-bit ARM, the ciphers are ranked respectively with an average value under scenario 1(communication protocol) and scenario 2(authentication protocol). Until now, 18 lightweight block ciphers have entered this competition. In this paper, we firstly analyze the C and assembler implementations, and summarize some common optimization methods. Then, we give the implementations of the lightweight block cipher RECTANGLE on the three devices. Furthermore, we optimize the three basic operations AddRoundKey, SubColumn and ShiftRow. The results are as follows. The Flash reduces 42.6% and the time reduces 36.8% respectively for the round function on ARM. For scenario 1 on AVR, the RAM and time of RECTANGLE-128 reduce 12.0% and 5.0%, with that of RECTANGLE-80 reducing 10.9% and 2.8%.

Thus it is significant to grasp the pond water temperature change for the healthy aquaculture. In order to solve the problems of low precision and poor robustness of traditional forecasting methods, a short-term prediction model of water temperature in aquaculture pond was proposed based on BP neural network optimized by genetic algorithm, and pond aquaculture water temperature prediction system was designed and developed.

The intellectualization of agricultural machinery is the symbol of a country's engineering and technical strength. How to co-ordinate the multidisciplinary technologies and reasonably integrate them into a system is the key to the success of intelligent agricultural machinery. According to the requirements of the development of land scale management in China, intelligent agricultural machinery should use advanced technology in the aeronautics, astronautics and ground to achieve high-speed computing and transmission of data information in a dynamic environment, and to command the actuator to complete the tasks efficiently and effectively.

Design of ambient hybrid energy harvesting system for self-powered sensor node,传感器节点自主供电的环境混合能量收集系统设计,2017,"The agricultural internet of things (Ag-IoT), which promotes deep integration of modern information and agricultural technology, has become the focus in precision agriculture research. However, it is inconvenient to replace the battery for sensor nodes in real applications due to the facts of complicated farmland environment, large monitoring area, numerous sensor nodes and long crop growth cycle, which brings a big challenge to the power supply of Ag-IoT sensor node. Fortunately, with the rapid development of the electronic technology, the power consumption for the wireless sensor node decreases quickly, which has reached the muW level, and the ambient energy harvesting technology makes it possible for Ag-IoT sensor nodes to have self-power supply and free maintenance. The traditional energy harvesting devices are always limited to only one sort of ambient energy and have big size with poor reliability. This paper proposed a novel hybrid ambient energy harvesting integration system, focusing on the RF (radio frequency) energy and vibration energy which are rich in the environment. A new type of integrated hybrid ambient energy harvesting device was designed, and the RF energy and vibration energy could be harvested at the same time by the combination of the RF antenna and the piezoelectric ceramic effectively. The system consisted of antenna, matching network, piezoelectric module and rectifier. The antenna received the RF(radio frequency) electromagnetic wave and the matching network improved the power transmission from the antenna to the rectifier, and 2 Schottky diodes and 2 capacitances were used to form the double-voltage rectifier. To reduce the size and improve the conversion efficiency, the rectifier was designed to rectify both the RF electromagnetic wave and the low frequency vibration signal. The converted DC (direct current) power was saved in a super capacitance which had high quality factor with very low leakage current. The energy harvesting antenna was designed in an array with 4 antenna elements in order to collect more RF energy. It was simulated and optimized at the frequency of 1.9 GHz (3G band) by using 3D (three-dimensional) electromagnetic simulation tool HFSS (high frequency structure simulator), and the matching network was designed and optimized by using the ADS (advanced design system). The antenna was implemented by the common FR4 printed circuit board which had low cost. The energy harvesting system was measured by the VNA(vector network analyzer) and oscilloscope, and the measured return loss of the antenna was -20.5 dB, which agreed well with the simulation results. The maximum output power of the harvested RF energy could reach 38 mW, and meanwhile, considering the typical low vibration frequency in farmland enviroment, we used 10 Hz as the vibration frequency for the vibration energy converting measurement. The measured maximum output power of the harvested vibration energy could reach 25 mW, which met the power requirement of the low power consumption sensor node. This device not only improves the reliability for the system power supply and the adaptive capacity to the environment, but also reduces the size of the device obviously, providing a new way for solving the problem of sensor node power supply during the rapid development of Ag-IoT.","摘要:农田复杂环境及大面积监测需求对农业物联网传感器节点的供电提出了极大挑战,而环境能量收集技术则使低功耗农业物联网传感器节点的自供电及免维护成为可能。针对传统能量收集装置中收集的环境能量单一有限、装置体积大、可靠性差的问题,该文提出了一种新型混合环境能量一体化收集系统。该系统定位于环境中普遍而丰富的射频电磁波能量和振动能量,通过射频收集天线和压电陶瓷的有效结合,同时收集2种环境能量,并经整流转换成直流电能。能量收集天线使用普通FR4印刷电路板实现,工作在手机通信频段1.9 GHz(3G频段),测试的回波损耗为-20.5 dB,对电磁波能量收集的最高输出功率可达到38 mW,测得收集到的振动能量最大输出功率可达到25 mW,满足低功耗传感器节点的功率需求。该装置不仅可以有效提高系统供电的可靠性和对环境的适应能力,还大大降低了传统混合系统的尺寸,可为农业物联网快速发展中的传感器节点可靠供电问题提供参考。",作者关键词:sensors; rectifying circuits; design; agricultural internet of things; energy harvesting; RF energy; vibration energy; matching network,作者关键词:传感器; 整流电路; 设计; 农业物联网; 能量收集; 射频能量; 振动能量; 匹配网络
Edge ComputingAn Emerging Computing Model for the Internet of Everything Era,边缘计算:万物互联时代新型计算模型,2017,"With the proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) and the burgeoning of 4G/5G network, we have seen the dawning of the IoE (Internet of everything) era, where there will be a huge volume of data generated by things that are immersed in our daily life, and hundreds of applications will be deployed at the edge to consume these data. Cloud computing as the de facto centralized big data processing platform is not efficient enough to support these applications emerging in IoE era, i.e., 1) the computing capacity available in the centralized cloud cannot keep up with the explosive growing computational needs of massive data generated at the edge of the network; 2) longer user-perceived latency caused by the data movement between the edge and the cloud;3) privacy and security concerns from data owners in the edge; 4) energy constraints of edge devices. These issues in the centralized big data processing era have pushed the horizon of a new computing paradigm, edge computing, which calls for processing the data at the edge of the network. Leveraging the power of cloud computing, edge computing has the potential to address the limitation of computing capability, the concerns of response time requirement, bandwidth cost saving, data safety and privacy, as well as battery life constraint.

An Elastic Scalable Stream Processing Framework Based on Actor Model,一种基于Actor模型的弹性可伸缩的流处理框架,2017,"In the era of big data, stream processing has been widely applied in financial industry, advertising, Internet of things, social networks and many other fields. In streaming scenarios, the generation speed of stream data tends to be fluctuant and difficult to predict. If the streaming peak is larger than system capacity, the system may run slowly or even crash, which leads to job failure. If excessive resources are provided in case of streaming peak, there can be unnecessary waste under light load.

Hypermedia Oriented Privacy Modeling Method for RESTful Service,面向超媒体链接的RESTful服务隐私建模方法,2017,"Representational state transfer service(RESTful service) has gained widespread acceptance as a simpler alternative to SOAP/ WS-*Web services. Acknowledging the hypermedia nature of RESTful service, the response of the RESTful usually contains links that can be used as the engine to fire new resource request. The complex internal state transitions in the service request/response process can lead to bigger privacy risks. How to accurately depict privacy actions in this dynamic interactive context driven by the hypermedia is one fundamental issue in RESTful service privacy protection research. In this paper we present a RESTful application state privacy model based on single-event finite automaton and discuss the automatical transformation method from RESTful service description to that formal model. We establish the privacy action meta-model to depict the atomic privacy action with accurate semantics and formally define some kernel elements of RESTful service and the relationship among them. We then discuss how to transform the RESTful service resources to the corresponding privacy actions. In addition, we propose a new data structure called resource link mapping tree to represent the relationship between the RESTful service resources and links. A transformation method based on the resource link mapping tree is introduced to generate the corresponding privacy actions from the RESTful service definition and further generate the formal single-event automata with the algorithm considering both protocol links and hypermedia links.

[Wastewater Quantity and Quality Fluctuation Characteristics of Typical Area of Hybrid Sewage System].,,2016,"The inflow and infiltration problems cause large fluctuation in wastewater quantity and quality in hybrid sewage system. This seriously challenges the operation and management of sewage system. A multi-point on-line simultaneous monitoring system was established in a typical hybrid sewage system. The key characteristic parameters and their variation features under different circumstances were studied. The result indicated that the daily variation rule was obvious and appeared synchronous among multiple points at normal water level under dry weather flow, but there was no synchronization in conductivity variation among multiple points at high water level under dry weather flow. The statistical distribution range of water level and conductivity was significantly impacted by the seasonal rainfall change under dry weather. The statistical distribution ranges of water level variation rate and conductivity variation rate in specific time were significantly impacted by the rainfall. The response features of water level and conductivity to rainfall intensity and pattern were significantly different under different circumstances. The response sensitivity of conductivity was higher than water level at normal water level and lower at high water level. The database which could support the optimization of operation and management in the hybrid sewage system was proposed based on the distribution law of wastewater quality and quantity fluctuation under dry and wet weather, as well as the variation rate features of wastewater quality and quantity during rainfall obtained using the multi-point on-line simultaneous monitoring system.",,,"研究方向:Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences (由 Clarivate Analytics 提供)"

Application of similar Liu system in underwater weak signal detection,,2016,"Weak signal detection is a vital technology in underwater acoustic communication with strong noise background. In this area, non-autonomous Duffing system is still widely used, and a lot of researches focus on enhancing the ability to detect weak signal and to find out the detection limitation of the Duffing system. Moreover, great achievements have already made. But problems still exist such as non-convergence of the periodic state of the Duffing system and its narrow detection domain. Unfortunately, researches on weak signal detection by using other systems are still rare. In order to solve the above problems, a new three-dimensional similar Liu chaotic system for weak signal detection is proposed. A thorough theoretical analysis for the similar Liu chaotic system is given, and its equilibrium point and the Lyapunov index are deduced and analyzed in detail. The major conclusion is that the variable x of the new system becomes a deformation signal when the input signal amplitude is greater than a certain critical value, the variables y and z converge to zero, and the Lyapunov exponents are less than zero at the same time. This means that no matter how strong the input signal is, the detection can be achieved by using a similar Liu chaotic system as long as its amplitude exceeds the threshold value. The periodic convergence and wide area detection of the similar Liu chaotic system are proved by the Matlab simulation, the Multisim circuit simulation, and the actual circuit test. This new system solves the two problems of the period convergence and narrow detection domain for the traditional Duffing system. The periodic state and chaotic state are easy to distinguish when detected. The periodic state can be maintained when the signal amplitude changes from short distance to long distance in a new system. The spectral signal-to-noise ratio range increases up to -46.57 dB in the similar Liu chaotic system. The characteristics of the new system are only effected by its structure and parameters. The system does not rely on the external factors, and it can be extended. By using some switching devices, the conversion between the chaotic state and periodic state can be realized in the practical engineering applications with a higher detection accuracy. The new design concept of the similar Liu chaotic system shows a very high practical value. It will lay a certain foundation for the underwater acoustic communication of the ocean internet of things in the future.",,作者关键词:similar Liu system; Duffing system; chaotic circuit; weak signal detection,

Therefore,safety production and social economic development ought to be closely related to how for human beings to empower their own skills on dealing with the big data technology in the field of safety production,though the field of safe production has not yet been mature enough to be made a standardized data source. This article intends to demonstrates the technology application and development trend of the so-called big data. For this purpose,this article illustrated lots of different types of digital data to summarize how big data can be put into the safety production though successful application. Starting from the construction of big data resources, this article has proposed an integrated systematic data architecture for the safe production and through the method of distributing computer memory based on the technology to implement the aforementioned architecture. To clarify the situation,we have made an exploration and approaches to how big data are used in the safety production from the following four aspects,that is,data acquisition,transmission,storage,the active intelligent safety monitoring system over the big data,the construction safety supervision data standard system,and the data supply and talent gap. In so-doing,the author has made a deep-going exploration and discussion on the direction of big data application of safety rules in production in order to identify and determine the application and development trend of big data,as well as summarize the current safety production status-in situ application.

To understand the propagation properties of radio channels,signal propagation characteristics at different frequencies,heights and distances were tested in coniferous forest environment, white pine forest in Chinese Academy of Forestry. The results showed that signal strength was inversely proportional to distance within 10-20 m. Within the distance between 20 and 60 m,signal intensity did not attenuate much but the disproportional relationship with distance was not obvious. The signal intensity of each band attenuated significantly when it was over 60 m. Signal intensity at 433 MHz band was significantly higher than other bands,which was most suitable for wireless communication in forestry environment. The higher the frequency got,the smaller range the signal fluctuated,however,attenuation became stronger.

However, the prior vulnerability searching methods are limited to the same platform, which can't be directly extended to the cross-platform case, and the cross-platform studies have just started.

Firstly we extract the selected compared features from the call graphs, the basic attributes and the control flow graphs of the two compared functions as the input of the neural network, and gain the calculated results. Then we match the call sub-graphs of the compared functions with the results of the previous step as weight to improve the accuracy. The experimental results on the open source code OpenSSL demonstrate our method has better performance than the prior cross-platform vulnerability searching method with the Top1 increasing from 32.1% to 76.49% in the searching pattern from ARM to MIPS.

Automatic acquisition and classification system for agricultural network information based on Web data,基于Web数据的农业网络信息自动采集与分类系统,2016,"The purpose of this study is to obtain agricultural web information efficiently, and to provide users with personalized service through the integration of agricultural resources scattered in different sites and the fusion of heterogeneous environmental data. The research in this paper has improved some key information technologies, which are agricultural web data acquisition and extraction technologies, text classification based on support vector machine (SVM) and heterogeneous data collection based on the Internet of things (IOT). We first add quality target seed site into the system, and get website URL (uniform resource locator) and category information. The web crawler program can save original pages. The de-noised web page can be obtained through HTML parser and regular expressions, which create custom Node Filter objects. Therefore, the system builds a document object model (DOM) tree before digging out data area. According to filtering rules, the target data area can be identified from a plurality of data regions with repeated patterns. Next, the structured data can be extracted after property segmentation. Secondly, we construct linear SVM classification model, and realize agricultural text classification automatically. The procedures of our model include 4 steps. First of all, we use segment tool ICTCLAS to carry out the word segment and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, followed by combining agricultural key dictionary and document frequency adjustment rule to choose feature words, and building a feature vector and calculating inverse document frequency (IDF) weight value for feature words; lastly we design adaptive classifier of SVM algorithm. Finally, the perception data of different format collected by the sensor are transmitted to the designated server as the source data through the wireless sensor network. Relational database in accordance with specified acquisition frequency can be achieved through data conversion and data filtering. The key step of data conversion can be implemented on the basis of mapping rules between source data and target data. The mapping rules include 3 kinds of rules. The first is the source data directly corresponding to the target data; the second is that we create a temporary table, which corresponds to target table if they have same field name; and the third is converting perception data of XML (extensible markup language) type to relational database. Besides, data filtering is required to process abnormal values of the measured value beyond the sensor range. In this paper, unified modeling language (UML) is used to describe the agricultural network information automatic acquisition and classification system. User requirement analysis is described by the system's use case diagram. Web data extraction process is described by the system activity diagram. These help the system's key function implement of automatic information acquisition from Internet. The IOT data sharing module is implemented based on the proposed data conversion and filtering rules. The system can supply the services of on-time agricultural news, agricultural product prices, supply and demand information browsing query, real-time agricultural environment monitoring and personalized information statistics. The preliminary application shows that the agricultural network information automatic acquisition and classification system improves the accuracy of information extraction and text classification. The information acquisition accuracy rate for sample web sets is 98.2%, and the accuracy rate of text classification with rules is 92.5%. Compared with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), Bayesian, C4.5 decision tree and radial basis function (RBF) based SVM algorithm, linear SVM is more suitable for agricultural news classification. The system has high real-time performance and good user participation for IOT applications, which will expect to be applied to agricultural information integration and intelligent processing.","摘要:为了快速、高效地获取农业Web信息,解决信息孤岛和信息不对称的问题,重点研究了农业Web数据自动采集与抽取、基于SVM(support vector machine)的文本分类、物联网异构数据采集等技术,并采用统一建模语言(unified modeling language,UML)描述了农业网络信息自动采集与分类系统。该系统实现了农业网站、物联网数据的自动抓取和共享,为用户提供农业资讯、农产品市场行情、供求信息在线查询,环境数据实时监测和个性化信息服务等功能。应用结果表明,该系统对样本集网站的信息抓取准确率为98.2%,资讯分类准确率为92.5%,具有数据采集实时性强、用户参与度好、通用性高等特点,该系统为农业信息整合和服务提供参考。",作者关键词:agriculture; text processing; information systems; information; the Internet of things,作者关键词:农业; 文本处理; 采集系统; 信息; 物联网

Green Hierarchical Management for Distributed Datacenter Containers,分布式集装箱数据中心的绿色层次化管理,2016,"In recent years, modular datacenters (datacenter containers) have become promising IT infrastructure solutions due to their impressive efficiency and scalability. Pre-fabricated containers can be deployed not only in existing warehouse-scale datacenter facilities for capacity expansion, but also in urban/remote areas to support onsite Internet of Things (IoT) data processing. Combing conventional centralized datacenter servers with distributed containers can offer cloud providers new opportunities of exploiting local renewable energy resources and reducing unnecessary data movement overhead. This paper investigates a hierarchical management strategy for emerging geographically distributed datacenter containers. We logically group distributed datacenter containers into multiple classes that have different data accessing patterns. During runtime a central navigation system is used to monitor the utilization of each container class and perform dynamic sleeping scheduling to further improve the overall energy efficiency. Experimental results on our scaled-down test-bed show that the proposed mechanism can save 12%~32% energy cost while ensuring high performance.","摘要:近几年,模块化数据中心(集装箱数据中心)因其高能效可拓展的特点而成为极具前景的IT基础设施解决方案.预定制的集装箱数据中心不仅可以被部署在传统仓库级数据中心设施中以支持容量扩展,还能够被部署在城市/郊外以支持物联网数据的本地处理.把传统集中建设和管理的数据中心与地理上分布的模块化数据中心结合起来,能够更加方便地利用本地绿色能源发电以及减少数据传输成本.针对目前涌现的地理上分布的集装箱式数据中心模块提出了一种新型分层化管理模式,该技术将分布式集装箱数据中心逻辑上划分成多个性质和功能不同的层级.一个中央调配系统被用来监控每个层级的集装箱数据中心并施加动态休眠机制以进一步提升数据中心的整体效能.小规模测试实验结果显示分层化管理机制能够提升12%~32%的数据中心整体能效,并且保持较高的服务性能.",作者关键词:cloud computing; datacenter container; green computing; hierarchical management; performance evaluation,作者关键词:云计算; 集装箱数据中心; 绿色计算; 分层管理; 性能评估

A Survey on Localization Model in Wireless Networks,无线网络定位综述,2016,"In this paper we discuss the models of localization in wireless networks with the use of wireless technologies.A universal formal description of wireless localization is proposed from the standpoint of mathematical models,which can cover the technologies of ranging measurement and ranging estimation,the mapping function from original data to localization result in 2dimensional or multi-dimensional space,and relative localization or absolute localization. Whether the mapping function of the formal description exists or not means the feasibility of wireless localization, and this is the problem of unique realization or the rigid graph,so we give a deep analysis and summary of the unique realization doctrine and the rigid graph doctrine afterwards and point out that these two doctrines are in fact the same in describing localization feasibility problem.Then, from mathematical standpoint,various information collecting techniques are summarized as working information collecting in mathematical models,which includes distance ranging technologies such as TDoA,angle measuring technologies(AoA)and distance estimating technologies.The description of working information collecting can cover other information that can be used to do the localization and can be viewed as the basis to carry out optimization or extension for wireless localization.After that,we focus on single-target localization model in wireless networks.

Design of agricultural greenhouse environment monitoring system based on internet of things,基于物联网的温室大棚环境监控系统设计方法,2016,"At present, the communication protocol of the agriculture Internet of Things (IoT) is not uniform. To pack and transmit agricultural information better, a suitable protocol of the IoT, i.e. AGCP (Agricultural Greenhouses Communication Protocol), was proposed for agricultural communication, and an agricultural greenhouse monitoring system was designed using AGCP protocol combined with IoT. AGCP includes a set of data communication format, and defines the parameters in the protocol. There are variable design used for the data transmission which is collected by sensor, and command parameters used for equipment control, as well as function parameter which represents status and the function of sensor. Taken advantage of AGCP, firstly, a wireless sensor network for data transmission based on ZigBee technology was designed, which was used as coordinator in the perception layer. Secondly, terminal node core packaging, acquisition function node, such as temperature and humidity sensor, and the control function node, such as pump, were designed respectively. Then the agricultural environment information acquisition and equipment control by terminal had been realized. Thirdly, in functional module, communication protocols of the specific function modules were designed based on AGCP and characteristics of different modules, so the light control module, temperature control module, irrigation control module were detailed designed respectively. Finally, Android system was designed as mobile terminal with various core classes. The architecture of the UI interface, initialization, network communications, sensor equipment and automatic control were realized, respectively, which were used for remote monitoring on mobile terminal. The system test and analysis had been carried out in an agriculture park of Qingyuan city, Guangdong province. All kinds of sensor data from agricultural greenhouses were recorded at 12 pm, April 7, 2016. The greenhouse temperature, the humidity, the concentration of carbon dioxide, the light intensity, the soil temperature and humidity were 21.4 ℃, 65.3%, 867 mg/m~3, 690 Klux, 20.06 ℃ and 6.6%, respectively. Furthermore, from the historical record of different sensor data, it was shown that carbon dioxide concentrations in agricultural greenhouse changed quickly, but kept steady in a short period. The temperature was risen gradually. On the contrary, humidity was declined, while light intensity, temperature and humidity also maintained stable, which were in accordance with local environmental characteristics at that time. Additionally, the generator of carbon dioxide, water pump, fan, and fill light were successfully controlled by setting. It is shown that the system can collect the agricultural environment information, including the air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, soil moisture and the corresponding equipment automatic control, with very good performance. The results verify the effectiveness of the AGCP protocol in the Internet of things of agriculture as well as the feasibility of building the system.","摘要:目前农业物联网通信协议尚不统一。为了更好地封装和传输农业信息,提出一种适用于农业物联网的通信协议AGCP(agricultural greenhouses communication protocol)。利用AGCP协议结合物联网架构完成了基于物联网架构的农业大棚监控系统的设计,重点完成了感知层中协调器和节点终端的信息采集以及设备控制的软硬件设计,并详细设计了光照控制模块、温度控制模块和灌溉控制模块,最后进行了系统测试和分析。试验表明,该系统能有效监测温室大棚的空气温度、湿度、二氧化碳以及土壤湿度等农业环境信息,并能进行相应设备的自动控制,验证了AGCP协议在农业物联网的有效性以及构建系统的可行性。",作者关键词:greenhouses; sensors; design; internet of things; communication protocol; monitor and control system,作者关键词:温室大棚; 传感器; 设计; 物联网; 通信协议; 自动监控系统

Privacy-Preserving k-NN Query Protocol for Two-Tiered Wireless Sensor Networks,面向双层传感网的隐私保护k-NN查询处理协议,2016,"As an important part of Internet of Things (IoTs),Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs)can be widely deployed in many physical environments for data collection and monitoring,such as oceans,volcanoes,animal habitats and battlefields.In these applications of WSNs,k Nearest Neighbors(k-NN)query which returns the nearest k objects of the given query location or value is very important for users to get the required information of monitoring areas.In consideration of the built-in resource limitation problems of single tier sensor networks,k-NN query can be more efficient in two tiered WSNs which contain a large number of resource constrained sensor nodes and fewer resource rich management nodes.However,relying on management nodes for data storage and query processing raises significant security concerns.Frequently,the deployment environments of WSNs are hostile and unpredictable,which threaten the data security and privacy.What is worse,the open nature of wireless communication makes it easy for adversaries to eavesdrop data packets or compromise nodes of sensor networks.Management nodes are more vulnerable to be compromised as they store massive data and serve as an important role for responding queries. The compromised management nodes bring serious security risks to the network and significantly restrict the development of two tiered WSNs.Therefore,in recent years,privacy preservation in two tiered WSNs has attracted more and more attention.Accurately answer k-NN query while preserving data privacy is a challenging problem.This paper presents an efficient privacy-preserving k-NN query protocol for two tiered WSNs.To the best of our knowledge,this paper is the first to consider collusion attacks for a value-based k-NN query in two tiered WSNs while fulfilling the preservation of privacy.To improve query efficiency,the architecture of k-NN query is proposed based on the directional storage strategy for two tiered WSNs.To resist management nodes compromising attacks,this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving data encoding mechanism to conceal sensitive information to response the accurate query result without data privacy leakage. Then,to resist nodes collusion attacks,we present a proxy-nodes-based one-way data hiding mechanism to disorder the data correlation between common sensor nodes and management nodes.In addition,a series of improve schemes are further introduced to enhance the performance of proposed privacy-preserving approaches,including group-based random storage mechanism, dynamic query mechanism,subfields partition mechanism and data code compression mechanism. Finally,theoretical analysis and experimental results of real dataset confirm the privacy and efficiency of our proposals.","摘要:无线传感器网络作为物联网感知层的核心组成部分,具有广阔的应用前景.然而,隐私泄露问题严重阻碍了传感器网络的发展.目前,传感器网络隐私保护技术已成为研究热点,其中隐私保护k-NN(k-Nearest Neighbor)查询协议是富有挑战性的问题.文中提出了面向双层传感器网络的高效的隐私保护k-NN查询协议.首先,为提升查询效率,基于定向存储策略给出了适用于双层传感网的k-NN查询架构.其次,针对管理节点俘获攻击,提出了一种新颖的隐私保护数据编码机制,通过为真实数据附加编码的方式,保证在不泄露数据隐私的同时精确地完成查询处理.再次,针对节点共谋攻击,设计了基于代理节点的单向数据隐藏机制,通过破坏普通节点与管理节点间数据的关联性实现抵御共谋攻击的目标.理论分析和仿真实验验证了协议的安全性和有效性.",作者关键词:Internet of Things; wireless sensor networks; privacy-preservation; k-Nearest Neighbor query; node compromising; collusion attack,作者关键词:物联网; 无线传感器网络; 隐私保护; k-NN查询; 节点俘获; 共谋攻击

This paper proposes data aggregation transmission scheduling,which includes two steps.The first step is to create an optimal aggregation routing tree with channel constraints.The basic idea is to choose the links with more connected timeslots as edges on the tree to optimize the space of transmission time scheduling.At the same time,the algorithm needs to satisfy that the amount of inter-tree conflicts in the interference range is less than the amount of channels in order to realize multi-channel transmission without conflicts.The second step is to schedule the optimal transmission time.The key point is to utilize limited wireless resource to aggregate data to AP as much as possible without transmission conflicts.In this part the paper proposes a dynamic programming algorithm to get optimal transmission scheduling.Finally,we conduct a mass of simulation experiments on a real taxi trajectory data set.The result demonstrates that compared with existing data aggregation algorithms,our algorithm improves nearly 1/4 in the data collection rate,and decreases the average delay.","摘要:智能交通系统上的实时导航、交通监控、安全保障等应用需要实时地收集大量的交通流量、车辆位置以及道路通行时间等信息.车上很多传感器(如GPS)可以实时采集这些数据,而由车及路边设备构成的车联网可以实时地传输这些数据.面对大量感知数据的实时传输,无线通信能力远远不能满足传输需求,而车移动导致的链路变化又使得无线信道资源很难被高效利用.该文综合了3个方面内容来解决这一问题:考虑基于802.11p的多信道数据传输提高无线传输能力;利用数据聚集降低数据传输量;利用网络动态变化结构规划高效的传输.该文提出的数据聚集规划包括两个步骤:首先是构建一棵带信道个数约束的优化聚集路由树.基本思想是通过选择连通时刻较多的链路作为树边优化传输时刻可规划的空间.同时建树时需要满足干扰半径内的树间冲突数量不大于信道数量,实现多信道无冲突并行传输;然后规划优化的传输时刻.其核心是在避免树内冲突的前提下利用有限的无线网络资源将尽可能多的数据聚集到AP节点.该文给出了一个动态规划算法实现了最优传输规划.该文在真实轨迹数据集和模拟轨迹数据集上进行了大量的对比实验.结果表明该文的方法在数据收集率上比现有算法提高了近1/4,同时也减少了数据平均收集延迟.",作者关键词:VANET; data aggregation; dynamic programming; multi-channel; data collection; Internet of Things,作者关键词:车联网; 数据聚集; 动态规划; 多信道; 数据收集; 物联网
A Strong K-Barrier Construction Scheme Based on Selecting Box for Directional Sensor Networks,一种基于选择框的有向K-栅栏构建算法,2016,"K-barrier coverage is one of the hot spot in directional sensor network.This paper models MDNSB (strong barrier of minimum directional node)and mainly proposes DSBCSB(directional strong barrier construction based on selecting box)scheme.In MDNSB,sensors with both sensing angle less than 60°and greater than 60°have the largest sense distance toward the direction of barriers.Actuation energy consumption is firstly modeled as the sum of mobility and motility energy consumption.In DSBCSB,first,Barrier location with the largest number of nodes is chosen as barrier target by barrier selection box.Second,directional node selecting box with target location as a center is created.The node with least actuation energy consumption in selecting box moves to target location and turns its sensing direction for 1-barrier construction. Then,vertical barrier is built up between two horizontal adjacent subareas.Finally,these barriers are merged into strong 1-barrier coverage;k strong 1-barriers could build up directional strong K-barriers coverage in area of interest.Simulation results show that our method could effectively constitute K-barrier coverage with 50%less quantity of nodes and 30%40%less energy consumption than other methods.This research has important theoretical and practical significance.","摘要:K-栅栏覆盖是有向传感器网络的研究热点之一.该文提出了一种含有最少节点的有向强栅栏覆盖模型(MDNSB).在这个强栅栏模型中,感知角度不管是小于60°还是大于等于60°,有向节点的最大感知距离都在栅栏方向.在此基础上,提出一种基于有向节点选择框的有向强K-栅栏覆盖构建算法(DSBCSB),以节点目标位置为基准构建有向节点选择框,选择框内运动能耗最少的有向移动节点运动到有向强K-栅栏的目标位置,形成有向强1-栅栏覆盖.其中的节点运动能耗由移动能耗和转动能耗两部分组成.水平相邻子区域的1-栅栏通过竖直栅栏联合起来构成强1-栅栏覆盖,多个强1-栅栏构成有向强K-栅栏覆盖.仿真结果证明了在形成G-栅栏的过程中,该方法比其他算法节省了40%~50%的节点,能耗降低了30%~40%.该文的研究对提升有向无线传感器网络的性能具有重要的理论与实际意义.",作者关键词:directional wireless sensor network; strong K-barrier coverage; sense distance; target location; node selection; energy consumption model; vertical barrier; Internet of Things,作者关键词:有向传感器网络; 强K-栅栏覆盖; 感知距离; 目标位置; 节点选择; 能耗模型; 竖直栅栏; 物联网
A Modeling Method Research Based on Data in Cyber-Physical System,一种基于数据驱动的CPS建模方法研究,2016,"Physical process and computing system are two aspects of CPS.The former focuses on processing continuous objects which requires time-dependent models,and the latter takes its attention in handling the discrete problems(0-1 formalism)in most cases,so it exists great difference in modeling method of this two aspects.Notice that the traditional modeling methods focused on states transition in general,which is difficult to predict in such a complicated environment of CPS,it didn't truly realize the interaction between the two aspects of CPS.In this paper,we obtained some discrete data from the real environment,and presented a new modeling mechanism called DCDM which started from the original data to build a continuous model through a mathematical method(GMDH).To decrease the relative error between them,we took the feedback control to the original data to adjust the error.Furthermore,from the adjustment of new discrete data,our method established the continuous modeling again by repeating the above steps until the error turns to an acceptable range.DCDM has fundamentally changed the traditional modeling style with the proposal of a new modeling direction which models the system from discrete data,and deeply realizes the integration between the discrete system and continuous system through feedback. DCDM has the following four advantages:(1)the modeling object is easy to be obtained and objective to reflect the system itself;(2)DCDM can directly select the suitable parameters through the GMDH to remove the redundancy attributes and minimize the factors impact on the system models;(3)Compared to other data fitting methods,DCDM has a simpler complexity to save a lot of computing time;(4)There is a significant improvement in the error between the discrete data and the continuous model.Experimental results show that the implementation of DCDM is faster than the current data modeling method,and it is more obvious with the increase of data.","摘要:信息-物理融合系统(CPS)由物理事件与计算系统两大部分组成,前者专注于处理连续的物理过程,与时间的流逝存在密切联系;后者则只能处理基于0-1机制的离散问题,两者存在本质上的差别.传统的建模方法一般需事先估计系统将要经历的状态及每一个状态转换所需的时间,这在复杂的CPS(Cyber-Physical System)环境中难以预测,也没有真正意义上实现计算系统与物理事件之间的交互.因此,我们提出一种新的建模方法DCDM:面向CPS的真实环境经传感器、网络等测试得出一些原始的离散数据,通过一定的数学方法(GMDH)从数据出发建立系统的连续模型,为了缩小离散数据与连续模型之间的误差,采用反馈控制的方式不断调整两者之间的差距,直至其减小到一定的范围之内.DCDM从根本上改变了传统的建模方式,提出了一种从离散数据出发建立系统模型的思想,通过反馈控制实现物理事件与计算系统之间的深度融合.DCDM具有以下4种优势:(1)建模对象容易获得且更加客观,能真实反映系统本身;(2)通过数学方法直接实现参数的筛选,去除冗余属性,减小弱影响因子对系统模型的影响;(3)相较于其他数据拟合的方法,DCDM具有更加简单的复杂度,能节约大量的计算时间;(4)在离散数据与连续模型之间的误差方面,相较于其他的算法有着明显的改进.实验结果表明,在真实数据集中,DCDM的执行速度快于当前最新的数据建模方法,且数据集越大优势越明显.",作者关键词:GMDH; cyber-physical system; GMDH; continuous system; discrete system; feedback control; Internet of Things,作者关键词:信息-物理融合系统; 连续系统; 离散系统; 反馈控制; 物联网

A Device-Free Passive Localization Method with the Elimination of Environmental Noise,一种有效消除环境噪声的被动式目标定位方法,2016,"Device-free Passive Localization(DFL)technique in Wireless Sensor Network uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator(RSSI)measurement of the wireless link which is caused by the monitoring object to estimate the object location.Since DFL doesn't rely on the object to carry any device or participate actively in the localization phase,it has a broad application prospect.Most RSSI based DFL work assume that the RSSI measurements are fixed.However, experiments and practical applications show this assumption is wrong,since different radio frequency interference in the real environment and the temperature and humidity changes will vary the RSSI measurement for the same location where the object in,leading to the localization accuracy decreased.To this end,in this paper,we introduce a DFL method which can eliminate the influence of environmental noise.We first propose the Finite State Markov Chain(FSMC) based linear migration model to divide the RSSI measurement into the environment caused noise component and object caused interference component,and use the interference component to construct the radio map;then we use the Dynamic Time Warping(DTW)algorithm to perform matching between the real-time interference component and the radio map,and obtain the object location.Since the interference component is related to the object location,but has nothing to do with the environment,using the interference component to conduct localization not only eliminates the influence of environmental noise,improves the localization accuracy,but also steadies the accuracy over time.The experimental results show that for the different environment and deployment,the influence of environmental noise on RSSI measurements can be effectively eliminated and the localization accuracy can be improved by this method.","摘要:无线传感器网络中的被动式目标定位是一种利用监测目标对无线通信链路的接收信号产生的影响(如信号强度变化)对目标位置进行估计的技术.由于这种定位技术既不要求目标携带任何无线设备,又不需要目标主动参与定位过程,因此具有重要的应用前景.在基于接收信号强度的被动式目标定位研究工作中,大多假设链路接收信号强度是固定不变的.然而,实验和实际应用表明,这种假设是错误的.因为场景中不同射频信号的干扰和温湿度变化等环境影响都会引起处于同一位置的目标对应的接收信号强度不同,从而导致定位精度下降.为此,该文提出了一种能够有效消除环境噪声对链路接收信号影响的被动式目标定位方法.该方法首先利用基于有限状态马尔可夫链的线性迁移模型,将接收信号分解为由环境引起的噪声分量和由目标引起的扰动分量,并利用扰动分量构建射频地图;然后通过动态时间规整算法将实时扰动分量与射频地图进行匹配,实现目标定位.由于扰动分量仅与目标的位置有关,与环境无关,因此利用扰动分量进行定位不仅能够有效地消除环境噪声的影响、提高定位精度,而且使定位精度不会随着时间的推移而下降.实验结果表明,对于不同的环境和部署方式,该文提出的方法可有效地消除环境噪声对链路接收信号产生的影响,提高定位精度.",作者关键词:wireless sensor network; Device-free Passive Localization (DPL); received signal strength indicator; finite state Markov channel; dynamic time warping; Internet of Things,作者关键词:无线传感器网络; 被动式目标定位; 接收信号强度值; 有限状态马尔可夫链; 动态时间规整; 物联网

Address Compression for Hierarchical Forwarding Architecture in IPv6 IoT,IPv6物联网层次转发体系中的地址压缩,2016,"As one of the most significant parts of ""Internet +"", Internet of things (IoT) is being widely applied in various aspects of human society. IPv6 identification is the base of large-scale deployment and interconnection of IoT.

Design and implementation of monitoring system for agricultural environment based on WebGIS with Internet of Things,WebGIS在农业环境物联网监测系统中的设计与实现,2016,"There are two of the main practical monitoring approaches in agriculture including remote-sensing monitoring and on-farm monitoring. Remote-sensing monitoring uses remote-sensing technologies and devices such as satellites and aerial vehicles to extract the key parameters of agricultural information. The remote-sensing technology is effective on regional-scale monitoring, but difficult to collect real-time information in farmlands. On-farm monitoring uses a variety of sensors deployed in farmlands as well as corresponding data processing and transmission equipment to dynamically acquire on-farm information. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on the sensor nodes has been widely used in the field of agricultural environment monitoring in recent years. However, when a regional-scale monitoring is carried out by using the IoT technology, there are some problems in the distribution of monitoring sites and the space representation of monitoring data. Aiming at the problems, an approach to evaluation of agricultural environment from on-farm sites to regional scales and the corresponding solution are proposed in this paper. Most of the factors of agricultural environment remain minor variation and appear to be uniform in the same ecological type region, except for extreme weather events or geographical conditions. Therefore, the agricultural environmental information acquired by an on-farm monitoring site could be regarded as the representation of the entire farm where the site located, and the agricultural environmental information of a representative farm could be also considered as the reflection of an entire ecological type region with similar geographical and environmental conditions. An IoT-based monitoring system has been put into application in the past five years which includes a total of 110 on-farm monitoring sites in representative regions of wheat belts across 14 provinces of China and a central monitoring platform. Based on the established central monitoring platform, a regional-scale monitoring system for agricultural environment is designed by integrating with the spatial analysis technology of WebGIS. In the system, three types of WebGIS-based functions were implemented, including site data positioning, regional-scale evaluation, and thematic mapping. Through an interactive online map, positioning, real-time display and query of on-farm sites information and collected data are realized in the site data positioning. The regional-scale evaluation is used for analysis of the collected agricultural environmental information, and decision-making on crop growth conditions and meteorological disasters from on-farm sites to regional scales, while the thematic mapping is used for automatic generation, dynamic display and query of regional-scale monitoring thematic maps of crop growth conditions and meteorological disasters based on the evaluation. The fusion analysis of ""on-farm"" IoT data and ""spatial"" WebGIS data is provided in accordance with the characteristics of monitored objects. The system has been put into application in monitoring of wheat growth conditions and meteorological disasters in Henan Province. And the case is demonstrated in dynamic regional-scale monitoring of wheat dry-hot wind occurred on May 11, 2013 in Henan Province. The result indicates that the system is effective when monitoring agricultural environment from on-farm sites to regional scales with dynamical update and the applicability on diagnosis in crop growth conditions and meteorological disasters is improved.","摘要:近年来物联网技术在农业环境监测领域得到了广泛的应用。物联网能够及时获取监测点上时间连续的数据,但在进行较大尺度的区域监测时,因空间变异性影响,基于节点的物联网监测技术面临着监测点分布设计、数据空间连续表达等诸多难题。针对农业环境监测对象的特点,提出了由点到面的区域模拟与评估方法,设计了一套将物联网基于""点""的监测数据与WebGIS基于""面""的空间数据融合分析的解决方案。在已建立的物联网监控中心系统平台基础上,优化集成WebGIS图形化空间分析技术,建立了物联网监测数据与WebGIS空间数据点面融合的农业环境监测系统。系统实现了数据位置地图显示、由点到面的区域模拟与评估、区域监测专题图管理3个功能。以河南省小麦灾情监测为案例对系统进行了应用分析,结果表明系统能有效地实现农业环境由点到面的区域动态监测,提高了作物长势与灾害的综合诊断能力,并能够为农业生产管理提供更为便捷的应用服务。",作者关键词:WebGIS; agricultural engineering; monitoring; design; internet of things; WebGIS; data fusion analysis,作者关键词:农业环境; 监测; 设计; 物联网; 点面融合
A lossless data compression and storage method of pump dynamometer,一种抽油机示功图数据无损压缩存储方法,2016,"Data storage of the pump dynamometer is one of key issues in oilfield informatization. If the pump dynamometer data are stored in real-time database, 500 data nodes should be used to store a piece of data for each well, thus leading to a high cost. In the use of traditional methods, dynamometer data are saved in relational database. However, this solution shows a lower reading efficiency, unbeneficial to real-time data analysis. Moreover, it is required to deploy database servers in oilfield production-operation zones and the organizations above the operation zones, and the cost is also higher. In application of the dynamometer data compression method for internet of things in production, through the calculation, analysis and validation on more than twenty thousand pieces of dynamometer data, pump dynamometer data can be effectively compressed to 1/250 of original data size by four steps, i.e., data processing, precision confirmation, difference solution and data storage. Such data can be saved in real-time database to reduce cost and improve effect. This solution has been adopted by several sub oil/gas field companies of CNPC to validate the practicability and save the investment cost.","摘要:抽油机示功图数据的存储是油田信息化重点关注的问题之一。若将抽油机示功图存储在实时数据库中,每口井每幅需要投入500个数据点进行存储,成本高昂;传统的抽油机示功图存储方法是将示功图数据存储在关系数据库中,此方法读取效率不高,不便于进行实时数据分析,且需要在油田生产作业区及作业区以上组织机构部署关系数据库服务器,代价依然昂贵。生产物联网示功图数据压缩方法,经过超过2*10~4幅示功图数据的计算、分析和验证,可以通过数据处理、精度确认、求取差值和数据存储4步计算将抽油机示功图数据有效压缩至原数据大小的1/250,直接存储于实时数据库中,实现了降本增效的目的。该方法经过中国石油天然气集团公司相关油气田公司的试用,验证了其实用性,节约了投资成本。",作者关键词:pumping unit; dynamometer; data compression; real-time database; internet of things,作者关键词:抽油机; 示功图; 数据压缩; 实时数据库; 物联网

Survey on Lightweight Hash Functions,轻量级Hash函数研究,2016,"With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IOT) and its applications, the information security and privacy problems become more and more important in the academic community and industry. Due to the limitations of production costs and portability, the computation, storage and power are still very constrained with the hardware of IOT, thus the security of IOT is mainly based on symmetric-key algorithms, such as block ciphers, hash functions and stream ciphers. Since hash functions play a pivotal role in digital signatures, data integrity, message authentication codes, etc., and the current hash functions widely used are still costly for IOT applications, it becomes a widely concerned topic on the construction and analysis of secure and fast lightweight hash functions that are suitable for resource-constrained environment. On the construction methods of various hash functions, three main categories (dedicated hash functions, block-cipher-based hash functions and provably secure hash functions) come from different design principles of iterated compression functions. Based on the different categories of the construction methods, we analyze the state of the art of lightweight hash functions that have been proposed in recent years. Moreover, the published cryptanalysis results on lightweight hash proposals are overviewed.

It therefore results in some shortcomings such as high cost of maintenance, heavy waste of energy, full service interruption, and delayed response to incident. This paper proposes a new method, namely, local and on-demand maintenance of clusters (LDMC), to carry out the operations of maintenance only in a restricted range of time and space which is decided by the damaged clusters. LDMC resolves issues such as when to start, which type or who to be maintained by the triggers, pre-processing or different operations of maintenance. The presented scheme is helpful not only to make critical decision on the timing of cluster update, but also to provide in-time response to the change of topology or route of network with the disabled or new nodes. As a result, it allows to reduce the impact of incidents on the function of network, to improve the stability of network, and to cut down the cost of maintenance. Comparison tests are performed on consumption of energy, transmission of data, balance of load and response to incident based on NS2 simulation platform, and the results suggest that the proposed method is able to significantly reduce energy consumption in maintenance of clusters, to prolong the lifetime of network, and to increase the total amount of the transferred data packets.","摘要:基于无线传感网的物联网感知层传统的全网、周期性重新成簇的簇维护模式因超范围过度维护,存在维护成本高、能量浪费严重、服务全面中断、响应不及时等缺点.局域按需簇维护方法(local and on-demand maintenance of clusters,简称LDMC)将簇维护操作控制在簇受损的时间和空间范围内,通过设置触发源、预处理和维护动作分别解决簇维护启动、簇维护方式和簇维护范围问题,不仅能够克服簇更新周期确定的困难,而且可在节点失效和新节点加入时对网络拓扑和路由变化及时进行响应,减小突发事件对网络功能的影响,改善网络的稳定性并降低其维护开销.基于NS2仿真平台,分别从能量消耗、数据传输、负载平衡和突发事件响应等角度对该方法进行了测试对比,仿真结果表明,该方法能够明显减少簇维护的能量消耗、延长网络生存时间,并增加传输数据包的总量.",作者关键词:sensing layer of the Internet of things; maintenance of cluster; incident-driven; local; on-demand,作者关键词:物联网感知层; 簇维护; 事件驱动; 局域; 按需

Traditional mote collaborative sensing mechanisms require developers to focus too much on interaction logics and can hardly adapt to the changing environment. To avoid over spending effort on interaction logics while ensuring that the projects can adapt to the unstable environment, this paper proposes a tuple space based collaborative sensing mechanism for intelligent sensors. It makes communication process completely transparent to developers. This paper also implements a simple demonstration to show how to use this mechanism to build system and how this system adapts to the environment.","摘要:随着具有一定计算能力和无线通信能力的智能传感器(称为mote)的出现,越来越多的物联网应用可以实现对环境及其变化的就地感知、就地决策和就地反应.但因为mote的感知能力和感知范围有限,它们需要协同感知才能更全面地感知环境的状态,才能更好地适应环境的变化.而传统的mote协同感知的实现方法要求开发人员过多地关注mote之间的交互逻辑,并且mote应用也无法适应复杂环境的不断变化.为了避免开发人员在交互逻辑上花费过多的精力,同时保障开发出来的mote应用系统能够适应不稳定的外界环境,提出了一种基于元组空间的mote 协同感知支撑机制,使得mote之间的协同感知过程(包括交互的建立过程以及对环境变化的适应过程)对开发人员完全透明.最后实现了一个简单的应用场景,展示了该方法如何满足功能需求以及在环境发生变化时如何对环境进行适应.",作者关键词:intelligent sensor; collaborative sensing; self-adaption; tuple space,作者关键词:智能传感器; 协同感知; 自适应; 元组空间
A method of lightweight intrusion detection for the Internet of things,一种面向物联网的轻量级入侵检测方法,2015,"To meet the demand of applications of the Internet of things with high real-time communications and limited resources, a method of lightweight intrusion detection is proposed to obviously reduce computation compared to traditional one of intrusion detection.

Then the algorithm of principal component analysis(PCA) is used to handle the results of cluster one by one for removing the useless features and retaining relevant ones to build the features set of class. In the process of detection,the Euclidean distance between the test data and the centers of classes in training process is firstly compared to get a center with minimum Euclidean distance. After that,the test data is put into the class of center. Then the proposed method is used to compare the feature set in this class with the test data to detect intrusion,an alarm will be issued if the results of comparison exceed the threshold,otherwise the detection is passed.

The use of multiple sensors to collect rabbit inner environmental data of air temperature and humidity, ammonia concentration and other environmental data was constructed by ad-hoc network between the nodes in the form of large-scale rabbit farm environmental monitoring wireless sensor network (WSN). As such, the realization of the rabbit breeding environment parameters can be on-line monitored based on remote transmission and monitoring results via a Web interface for data visualization display, query and trend of early warning indicators. When the monitoring data were more than threshold that led from favorable to bad environment, the system automatically alerted and reminded the breeding personnel to make preparations for the prevention, thus reducing the mortality of the rabbit. Rabbits multiply rapidly, and are vulnerable to inbreeding depression. When large-scale breeding reached to a certain number, recording the relationships between individual rabbits manually becomes impossible. The system model based on the coefficient of inbreeding and rabbit relative formula, and through the computer software system of the rabbit genetic information in storage in combination with calculation and analysis, the rabbit inbreeding coefficient and genetic relationship of the automatic calculation and analysis has been realized. The results showed that the maximum risk reduction of young rabbit quality affected by inbreeding depression was improved resulting in high survival rate and the yield of seed rabbit. The system has been applied to Guangdong's largest meat rabbit breeding enterprise for a year in three rabbit sheds with nearly total 900 rabbits in management. In comparison with the rabbit shed without the system installation, rabbit pups survival rate in the shed with the system increased by 5.15%, rabbit mortality dropped 3.33%. All reached the significant level (P<0.05). Through the application of the system, the enterprise work efficiency was improved, rabbit disease and mortality rates decreased significantly, the improvement of rabbit breeding, the survival rate and profit level in the enterprise had greatly improved.","摘要:针对规模化兔场易产生的环境恶化快、配种繁殖乱、近交衰退、管理效率低等问题,该文基于无线传感器网络、网络通信等物联网技术,设计了规模化兔场生产监管系统。在实现生产过程管理的同时,重点实现了规模化兔场的远程环境监测与亲缘关系分析功能。设计研制了低功耗兔舍环境监测节点,利用多传感器采集兔舍内氨气浓度、空气温湿度等环境数据,通过节点间自组网的形式构建了兔舍环境监测无线传感器网络,实现了兔舍养殖环境参数的远程传输与在线监测;基于近交系数与亲缘系数的公式模型,对种兔的遗传信息进行存储、计算与分析,实现了种兔亲缘关系的自动分析,最大限度的降低兔体质量受近交影响的风险。该系统已在广东骏威农业有限公司应用,结果表明与人工监管兔舍相比,系统监管兔舍仔兔存活率提高了5.15%,种兔死亡率下降了3.33%,均达到差异显著水平(P<0.05),企业生产效率和经济效益也得到全面改善。",作者关键词:wireless sensor networks; management information systems; monitoring; rabbit; inbreeding analysis,作者关键词:无线传感器网络; 管理信息系统; 监测; 兔; 近交分析

A Kind of New Anti-Collision Approach Based on AID,一种基于关联ID的防碰撞新方法,2015,"The RFID technology is one of the key technologies of the Internet of things which need to be studied. Based on our researches of the RFID technologies, a kind of new anti-collision approach based on AID (associated ID) has been put forward in this paper. As we know, the realization mechanism of anti-collision approach is between the tags with the memory and the memory-less tags.

This approach is different from that with the memory-less tags. Because there exists association relationship between father-tag and son-tag, when it is applied to the multi-tree searching method that we have proposed, the advantage of this method is that a single communication can identify multiple tags at one time, which has greatly improved the identification efficiency. When the approach is applied to the uncertainty ALOHA algorithm, the reader can decide the location of the empty slots based on the position of the binary pulse, so the working reader can avoid the efficiency decreasing problem caused by reading empty slots.

This system included several technologies: wireless sensor networks, remote information transmission networks, and the terminal fishery monitoring center. In this system, wireless sensor networks were applied to obtain fishery field data, including vessel position signals, monitoring information of electrofishing, and detection information of fishing vessel overload.

Remote information transmission networks comprised the mobile communications network of GPRS (general packet radio service)/GSM (global system for mobile communication) and internet. Fishery field data were transmitted by the mobile communication network and internet, and uploaded to the terminal fishery monitoring center through private data link immediately. The purpose of the terminal fishery monitoring center was to identify fishing vessels on the electronic map, monitor fishing violations, and provide assistance to fishery management.

A Reservation Slot Assignment Anti-Collision Protocol for the RFID System Considering the Capture Effect,基于捕获效应的预约时隙分配RFID防碰撞协议研究,2015,"For low cost Aloha protocols,there exists a hunger phenomenon that the reader cannot identify tags within limited times. This phenomenon will cause a serious problem that the reader misses tags in mobile RFID system. It is an effective solution to this problem to improve the identification efficiency of the Aloha protocols. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient anti-collision protocol based on the reservation of slots allocation considering the capture effect of the RFID wireless communication system. In this protocol based on the capture effect, each identification round is divided into two steps including the reservation and the identification. As results of the reservation, it avoids collision frame slots by using the detection mechanism when reservation collisions occur and empty frame slots by using the reservations of frame slots before readers allocate the frame slots. Furthermore,the optimal bit number of reservation random code and the optimal number of reservation slot are given to achieve the optimal efficiency. In addition, the tag estimation method suitable for the protocol is also proposed considering the capture effect.

LPCEP: HTF Storage Strategy and Instance Mapping Table Based Complex Event Processing Model for Long Process,LPCEP:基于HTF存储策略和实例映射表的长过程复杂事件处理模型,2015,"With the wide use of sensors and RFID devices and the development of the Internet of things,large quantities of event data are generated. Original event data must be processed by CEP in order to become valuable information with rich semantics. CEP has become research hotspot as an important part of the intelligent processing layer of the Internet of things. In practical applications,large numbers of event streams have the characteristics of long process,which demands the corresponding CEP to set large time windows and makes CEP face new challenges in the limited main memory. In all the current CEP methods,complex events are processed in the main memory without events stored and detected in the auxiliary storage. So,the current methods can not be applied in CEP for long process. Therefore,the paper proposes time slice based event instance storage strategy and instance mapping table based complex event detection method for large time windows,forming the CEP model for long process.

Application of the optical field leads to an appreciable tuning of the permittivity, which reached up to 7.5%. The observed behavior is interpreted in terms of mode softening due to the anharmonic character of its potential.

Cyber physical system spatio-temporal modeling method and its application in greenhouse control,信息物理系统(cyber-physical system)时空建模方法及在温室控制中的应用,2015,"Traditional agriculture uses manual way to control temperature and moisture in a greenhouse, but with the rapid development of modern agriculture, this high manpower investment and low accuracy control method cannot meet the needs of the modern agriculture. This paper used the concept of hierarchical finite state machine and lattice-based event to build a 3-layer cyber physical system model, and put forward a hierarchical finite state machine based spatiotemporal cyber physical system modeling method to design a new greenhouse control system. In these modeling methods, the cyber physical system was divided into three layers: physical layer, physical-cyber layer and the cyber layer. There were also two flows in cyber physical system: information gathering flow and decision control flow. The physical layer had sensor nodes, sensor motes and actors, the physical-cyber layer had sink nodes and controller nodes, and the cyber layer had a decision node. The hierarchical finite state machine can easily express the 3-layers system, the state transition between each layer, and the conversion relationship between the two flows in mathematical expressions. In the information gather flow, sensor nodes monitored the physical environment and generated sensor events, sensor motes used physical layer's hierarchical finite state machine to transform sensor events into physical events, and then passed physical events to sink nodes. Sink nodes used physical-cyber layer's hierarchical finite state machine to transform physical events into physical-cyber events. In the decision control flow, decision node used another physical-cyber layer's hierarchical finite state machine to transform the physical-cyber events into cyber events, and passed cyber events to the controller nodes, controller nodes used another physical layer's hierarchical finite state machine to transform cyber events into control events, and passed control events to the actors. At last, actors used the control events to change the physical environment. The lattice-based event modeling method can be used to divide cyber physical system event into three parts: event attributes, the observer information, the occurrence time and location and attribute information of the event. Event attributes referred that which type the event belonged to, the occurrence time referred that when the event happened, the occurrence location referred that where the event happened, and the attribute information of the event referred the physical environment. Because the 3-layer spatiotemporal model method considered the spatiotemporal attribute into the events of each layer's state machine, it improved the event detection and control accuracy in the greenhouse effectively, and ensured the greenhouse environment to meet the plant growth demands for temperature, humidity and light. The experiment proved that 3-layer spatiotemporal modeling method which realized the joint modeling with spatial and temporal attributes, reduced the error detection, improved the detection accuracy and the model performance was good. Compared with the traditional control methods based on ""Internet of Things"", we found that using 3-layers spatiotemporal cyber physical system modeling in facilities of agriculture, can improve the control accuracy from 80.20% to 87.20%, decrease the false control positive rate from 7.50% to 3.60% and the false negative rate from 12.30% to 9.20%, and it can also be adapted to the modern agriculture requirements of high precision and high automation.","摘要:传统农业采用人工方式对温室进行控制,但是随着现代农业的快速发展,这种人工投入大、精度低的控制方式已不能满足现代农业需要。该文基于分层有限状态机和事件晶格的概念,建立3层的信息物理系统模型,并提出一种基于分层有限状态机的信息物理系统时空建模方法,同时利用该建模方法开发了新的温室控制系统。该系统能够将物理层传感器感知到的温室物理环境数据通过物理-信息层汇聚节点融合后上报信息层决策节点得到决策信息,物理-信息层控制节点分析决策信息得到控制信息后下传物理层执行器进行控制。由于该系统模型考虑了各层状态机中事件的时空属性,能够将温室控制的正确率由传统基于物联网的温室控制方法的80.20%提高到87.20%,错误肯定率和错误否定率由7.50%和12.30%下降到3.60%和9.20%,保障温室环境满足作物生长对温度、湿度和光照的要求。",作者关键词:greenhouses; intelligent control; temperature; humidity; solar radiation; cyber-physical system; event lattice; hierarchical finite state machine,作者关键词:温室; 智能控制; 温度; 湿度; 太阳辐射; 信息物理系统; 事件晶格; 分层有限状态机

RFID Authentication Protocol Based on Cloud Database,基于云数据库的低成本RFID认证协议,2015,"With the widespread deployment of the IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud computing, a growing number of objects will access to the Internet using RFID tags to communicate with each other, which forms big data of RFID applications. The traditional backend central database based authentication schemes cannot satisfy the requirement because of the limit of computing and database searching.

The proposed scheme provides mutual authentications between the tag and the reader and between the tag and the cloud database. The proposed protocol satisfies security requirements, such as untraceability, forward security, withstand replay attack and anti-de-synchronization attack, etc. The security of the proposed authentication protocol is also analyzed using BAN logic.","摘要:随着物联网的广泛部署以及云计算的快速发展, 越来越多的物体之间需要相互识别、通信. 一方面, 海量的物品将依靠RFID技术进行识别和认证以接入互联网来完成彼此之间的通信, 这将会形成RFID应用大数据, 而传统的基于后台数据库的认证方案, 由于后端计算和搜索能力的限制将无法满足此需求; 另一方面, 部署和维护一个RFID后台数据库需要较高的成本, 不太适合中小企业的应用需求, 而云数据库可以采用按需租用、按时付费的方式来减小中小企业的部署成本, 因此基于云数据库的RFID系统有着更好的适应性. 然而, 基于云数据库的RFID系统中, 用户持有的阅读器是移动的, 而且RFID标签的隐私不能暴露给云数据库, 相比于基于传统后台数据库的RFID系统面临更为严重的安全威胁, 因此传统的RFID认证方案在云环境下不再适用. 文章提出了一种基于云数据库的低成本RFID认证方案, 方案基于单向哈希函数实现, 满足低成本的要求. 该方案不仅提供了标签与阅读器及标签与云后台数据库之间的相互认证, 而且满足不可跟踪性、前向安全性、抵抗重放攻击、抗去同步攻击以及抗拒绝服务攻击等安全特性. 基于BAN逻辑的分析表明, 所设计的协议是安全的.",作者关键词:RFID authentication; cloud database; BAN lo,作者关键词:RFID认证; 云数据库; BAN逻辑

Design and realization of a power-over-fiber sensor system for internet of things,物联网中的光纤供能传感系统设计与实现,2015,"In this paper,a sensor system for the internet of things under extreme environment is developed based on the power-over- fiber technique. Via this technique, high laser power is transmitted over fiber link,and is converted into electric energy by photovoltaic power converter (PPC) at the end of the link.

TouristsSpatio-temporal Behavior Based on Socially Aware Computing,基于社会感知计算的游客时空行为研究,2015,"From the traditional geography to the computational geography, then to the socially aware computing now, the research of tourism geography changes revolutionarily. In the information society where the concept of big data arises at a historic moment, touristsbehavior research has changed in such aspects as the data acquisition and calculation, the result feedback and so on. In the Big Data era, it is a tendency that human life is becoming more and more digital and networked by using sensor technology and situation aware technology to perceive human social behavior. Under this background, through a stepwise analysis of the development and connotation of socially aware computing, the tourism socially aware computing and its characteristics are confirmed. Based on predecessors' research, this paper analyzed the relationship between socially aware computing, touristsbehavior research and the geographic world, and put forward the concept model of socially aware computing of touristsbehavior by thoroughly analyzing the relationship among tourism management, sensing equipment, tourist activity and inference engine. Besides, this article also put forward socially aware computation analysis model and the study process of touristsspatio-temporal behavior. And taking the domestic tourists in Xian as a case, we discussed touristsspatio-temporal co-occurrence and touristsflow spatial structure in Xian, and studied the mutual relationship between tourists and their spatial behavior and the characteristics of network based on socially aware computation model. The result shows that the relationship between tourists is relatively weak, which is different from the resident, because sample data in this article are limited and the relationship of tourists is loose. In addition, by measuring district correlation, district transfer correlation and transfer tendency, the research also presents that there are very stable directed tourist flow transfer phenomena existing in the Bell Tower District, Qujiang District and Lintong District, so they can form an ""iron triangle"" of tourism development in Xian. The data were obtained from the travel notes and photos which tourists published in Sina Weibo. We are looking forward to providing a train of thought and reference for related research. Under the background of Big Data, the research of tourism is in the preliminary stage, so its correlation studies are limited. From other research fields, we can find that the researches of socially aware computing are concentrated on socially aware modeling, social data awareness, social interaction and rule analysis, intelligent and ancillary support and application. We anticipated the research direction of tourists socially aware computing in the future based on the current research progress of socially aware computing. In the future, this field will focus on the socially aware modeling of touristsbehavior, the real time awareness and the tourists behavior data mining, touristsbehavior rule analysis, the study under the intelligent and ancillary support, the application ofSmarter Tourismand the moving socially aware computation.","摘要:在情景感知、大数据、移动互联网和物联网发展的大背景下,迎合社会感知计算发展的趋势,探讨旅游社会感知计算内涵及其应用。在分析了现实地理世界、游客行为研究和社会感知计算之间关系的基础上,探讨旅游管理、传感器、游客活动和推理机的相互作用,构建了四位一体的游客行为社会感知计算概念模型。同时以西安国内游客为例,在新浪微博数据的支持和旅游社会感知计算框架下,探讨西安国内游客的时空共现和旅游流空间转移,探明了游客之间的相互关系和旅游空间行为及旅游流空间网络特征,为游客行为研究提供了思路和借鉴。同时在目前社会感知计算研究进展的基础上,展望了旅游社会感知计算未来的发展方向。",作者关键词:touristsbehavior; socially aware computing; big data; tourism digital footprint; computational geography,作者关键词:游客行为; 社会感知计算; 大数据; 旅游数字足迹; 计算地理学

Review of research on automatic guidance of agricultural vehicles,农业机械自动导航技术研究进展,2015,"The automatic guidance of agriculture vehicles is a key technology in precision agriculture and widely used in agriculture production. A review of the recent research in agriculture vehicle automatic guidance is presented in this paper, focusing on the position measurement, agriculture models and path tracking. And some forecasts are made on the trends of the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance. Generally, a modern agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system consists of 4 units: A detecting unit that measures the position and orientation of the vehicle; a control unit, as the core of the guidance system, which makes the plan of the path and carries out the path tracking; an executing unit that makes the turn of the wheels according to the command of the control unit; and a monitoring unit, or a field computer as it is called generally, which works as the interface between human and machine. There are 2 main problems to be solved in the agriculture vehicle guidance system. The first one is the measurement of the agriculture vehicle's working conditions, such as its position, heading, speed and wheel angle, among which the most important is the position measurement. There are 2 kinds of position measurement methods: One is the relative method, such as measuring the vehicle's position relative to a guidance baseline based on machine vision; the other is the absolute method, such as measuring the vehicle's absolute position on the earth based on the Global Navigation Satellite System. As the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system is working in the field, the complicated and non-structured environment makes none of the measurement methods working well all the time. So the multi-sensor data fusion is brought into sharp focus by researchers. By combining measuring data from different sensors with some data fusing methods, such as Kalman filter, particle filter, H filter, and intelligent methods, the measurement accuracy is improved. The integrated navigation systems are mainly GPS/INS, GPS/DR and INS/CNS. The second problem is agriculture modeling and path tracking control methods. Most of the path tracking control algorithms use kinematics models. The two-wheel model is the most frequently used model, in which an agriculture vehicle is regarded as a two-wheel vehicle and its pose is described by its geographical coordinates, heading, wheel angle and speed. Dynamics models based on the Newton second law are another kind of model commonly used. As it takes into account of the change of the vehicle's dynamic characteristics with the external environment and the farm implements, it makes the control algorithms more robust. Besides the control methods based on models, researchers have developed some kind of algorithm without a model. The PID is the most useful control strategy. Another one is the pure pursuit method which simulates the driving behavior of human and has foresight. Nowadays, the agriculture vehicle automatic navigation technologies have widely used in the agriculture production, but many problems still need to be studied further. The advanced navigation technologies are worth studying, such as the headland turning control, obstacle detecting and active collision avoidance, and cooperative navigation by multi vehicles. And the agriculture vehicle internet of things is another interesting research area.","摘要:农业机械自动导航是精准农业技术体系中的一项核心关键技术,广泛应用于耕作、播种、施肥、喷药、收获等农业生产过程。农机位置测量方法、农机模型与导航路径跟踪控制方法是农业机械自动导航技术的研究重点,受到国内外科研人员的广泛关注。农机位置测量主要有相对测量和绝对测量二类方法,前者以基于机器视觉的测量方法为代表,主要利用图像处理技术识别作物行,进而确定导航基准线,实现农机与作物的相对位置与航向信息的测量;后者则以基于全球导航卫星系统的测量方法为代表,利用卫星定位技术实现农机位置的高精度测量,在农业生产中应用最为广泛;而面对复杂的田间环境变化,在位置测量中应用多传感器数据融合技术通常可以得到更好的测量结果。导航路径跟踪控制通常以农机运动学模型或动力学模型为核心,多采用最优控制、最优估计、自适应控制、人工神经网络、模糊控制、鲁棒控制等现代控制理论与方法;而无模型控制方法则可以避免建模不准确或者模型参数剧烈变化对农机路径跟踪控制性能所产生的负面影响。该文从上述2个方面综述分析了农业机械自动导航技术的研究现状及存在的问题,并对未来农机导航技术的发展做出了展望,指出采用卫星导航技术,开展农机地头自动转向控制、障碍物探测及主动避障、多机协同导航等高级导航技术研究,以及引入先进的物联网技术,是现代农机自动导航技术发展的主要趋势。",作者关键词:agricultural machinery; navigation; models; internet of things for agriculture vehicles,作者关键词:农业机械; 导航; 模型; 农机物联网

Semantic annotating method of sensing data attributes for data processing in IoT,面向物联网的传感数据属性语义化标注方法,2015,"Data attribute description has a vital role in the physical significance and intelligent processing of sensing data and improves the usefulness of data effectively. It is an important basis of heterogeneous data sharing and integrating and heterogeneous resource interaction. However, with the development of IoT technology, established descriptions for sensing data attributes are specialized for specific purposes. The physical significance of sensing data is designed for specific applications. The expression of data significance is limited and the structure of data attribute descriptions is strong, which is difficult to achieve the extension of data attributes and reuse of data. In cross-domain applications, this hinders further data processing, which is strongly required in the IoT. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an ontology-based data attribute description method for sensing data processing. In this method, the approach of semantic description for data attributes with a layered ontology architecture, which extracts the data attribute information from the database storing the sensing data, allows the data attributes to be independent of specific applications. In the process of data access, the sensing data can be semantically annotated with data attributes for the requirements of specific applications. Further, extension of the data attributes can be achieved by reasoning technologies. This manner of semantic annotation for data unifies the semantic description of the data attributes and creates flexible data schemata. This method can effectively improve the physical significance and useful value of sensing data and can provide computers a more in-depth understanding and facilitate more intelligent data processing of the sensing data. The sharing and integrating of heterogeneous data and interacting of heterogeneous resources can be implemented based on this method.","摘要:数据属性在物联网感知数据物理意义表达和智能化处理方面起着非常重要的作用,可以有效提高数据的使用价值,是实现异构数据共享和融合、异构资源交互和协同的重要基础.然而,随着物联网领域技术的发展,当前数据属性的描述都是基于具体应用而定制化设计的,数据属性的结构化较强,数据很难被跨域理解和处理.针对这一问题,本文提出一种基于语义网技术的物联网数据属性标注方法.通过层次本体架构对数据属性进行语义化的描述,将数据属性从关系型数据库中抽象出来,使得数据属性独立于具体应用而存在;在数据访问的过程中,根据具体应用的需求有针对性地对数据进行属性的语义化标注,并通过推理技术实现数据属性的扩展.这种对数据的语义化标注方法有效实现了对数据属性的统一化描述和更为灵活数据模式的构建,提高了数据物理意义的表达能力和数据的使用价值,促进了计算机对数据更深入的理解和更智能化的处理,为物联网领域异构数据的融合共享和异构资源的交互协同提供了有力的技术支撑.",作者关键词:semantic web technology; ontology; data attribute description; semantic annotation; data processing,作者关键词:语义网技术; 本体; 数据属性; 语义化标注; 数据处理
Directory Cache Design for Multi-Core Processor,多核处理器目录缓存结构设计,2015,"With the development of Internet of things, cloud computing and Internet public opinion analysis, big data applications are growing into the critical workloads in current data center. Directory cache is used to guarantee cache coherence in chip multi-processor, which is massively deployed in data centers. Previous researches proposed all kinds of innovation to improve the utilization of directory cache capacity and scalability, making it more suitable for high-performance computing. Big data workloads are timing sensitive, which is not satisfied by previous works. To meet the requirement of big data workloads, master-salve directory is a novel directory cache design, which can optimize the path of memory instruction. In the novel directory cache design, master directory picks up private data accesses and provides services for them to reduce miss-latency, and slave directory provides cache coherence for shared memory space to improve the utilization of cache capacity and the scalability of chip multi-processor. Our experiment benchmark is CloudSuite-v1.0, running on Simics+GEMS simulator. Compared with sparse directory with 2*capacity, the experimental results show that master-slave directory can reduce hardware overhead by 24.39%, and reduce miss-latency by 28.45%, and improve IPC by 3.5%.

Among them, the localization and the location-aware of vehicles are key technologies of the IoV.

Automatic recognition algorithm of field operation status based on spatial track of agricultural machinery and corresponding experiment,基于农机空间运行轨迹的作业状态自动识别试验,2015,"With development and wide application of modern information technology as presented by the Internet of things, the position monitoring of operation process of agricultural machinery has been realized easily. But the existing remote monitoring system for agricultural machinery has only realized the remote storage, display and simple analysis. It is difficult to meet the requirements of fine management and intelligent data processing of agricultural machinery. In this paper, combining with the characteristics of the space track of agricultural machinery, the methods of clustering in data mining and spatial data analysis method were used to study automatic segmentation algorithm of field operation area based on spatial track of agricultural machinery. The procedure is as follows: firstly, data preprocessing, including velocity threshold and projection transformation methods, is preparing for further gridding and density slicing for the next step; secondly, spatial track of agricultural machinery was gridded; thirdly, density slicing removed low density cell-grids and preserved high density cell-grids; fourthly, spatial partition tree and spatial index are constructed, which is able to accelerating query speed of spatial nearest neighbors; finally, the cluster analysis is executed to connect high density cell-grids adjacently. The automatic identification of typical agricultural machinery operation method was designed and achieved. The quantitative analysis of the agricultural machinery operation divisions within the field operation time, transfer time and idle time of the agricultural machinery operation were divided and analyzed quantitatively. From May 27, 2012 to June 20, 2012, which is the season of wheat harvest, in order to verify the state of agricultural machinery operation cut automatic identification algorithm, the agricultural machinery tests were carried out in the Shijia Agricultural Machinery Cooperation in Xuchang City, Henan Province. Nine wheat harvesters, installing the embedded vehicle terminal based on GPS (positioning accuracy: 10 m, velocity measurement precision: 0.1 m/s) and GPRS (general packet radio service), were selected to do real harvesting task to produce spatial track data of agricultural machinery. The data collected by embedded vehicle terminal was used to verify the state of agricultural machinery operation cut automatic identification algorithm above. It showed that the accuracy of clustering algorithm based on spatial index and density slicing was above 89% in agricultural machinery test. After comparing clustering algorithm used in this paper with K-Means clustering algorithm and DBSCAN clustering algorithm, it is found that the clustering algorithm used in this paper has the best time efficiency, and the K-Means algorithm is better, and the DBSCAN algorithm has the worst run-time efficiency. It is shown that the construction of spatial partition tree and spatial index is very effective to accelerating query speed of spatial nearest neighbors, so it improves the clustering algorithm efficiency. But the current algorithm model is sensitive to the parameters of grid size and density threshold. The parameter setting depends on statistical analysis of spatial track of agricultural machinery. The grid size and density threshold are closely related to equipment width, working speed of agricultural machinery, and the frequency of GPS data uploading. The study direction in future is how to establish the quantitative relationship among the above parameters.","摘要:以物联网为代表的现代信息技术在农机作业管理领域的发展应用, 实现了农机作业过程的定位监控, 但现有农机远程监管系统对海量农机空间位置数据仅实现了远程存储、显示和简单分析, 难以满足农机精准管理和数据智能处理的要求。该文采用数据挖掘中的聚类和空间数据分析方法, 结合农机空间运行轨迹的特点, 研究了基于空间运行轨迹点的农机作业状态自动识别算法;设计实现了典型农机运行状态自动识别方法, 定量分析了农机作业班次内田间作业时间、空行转移时间、停歇时间的量化构成。农机试验表明:发展的基于空间索引和网格密度的聚类算法精度达89%以上。农机作业状态自动识别为农机作业生产率、农机利用率和作业成本核算提供了定量依据。",作者关键词:agricultural machinery; spatial track; clustering algorithm; automatic recognition of field operation status,作者关键词:农业机械; 聚类算法; 数据处理; 空间运行轨迹; 自动识别; 作业状态
Using clustering algorithm to visualize spatial-temporal internet of things data in process of agricultural product circulation,基于聚类的农产品流通物联网感知数据时空可视化技术,2015,"Stable environment is of vital importance in the process of long-distance circulation for agricultural products. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technique, it is relatively convenient to acquire the real-time data about the agricultural environment and the location data of the transport vehicle during the whole circulation process. In order to better perform the environment monitoring and position tracing, one can supervise the trajectory based on the collected IoT data through some current visualization approaches. However, the data collection of one specific trajectory on circulation for agricultural products is usually extremely large because the real-time data is usually required in real-world applications. Therefore, there still exist several open challenges to effectively and efficiently visualize the trajectory by large data collected on circulation for agricultural products. Firstly, there will be too many markers on the limited map once the visualization mapping is made directly from the original collected data set. Then the visual overload problem may occur when loading all the markers on the screen. Meanwhile, it also wastes computational resources to be rendered for the large scale data set, and it will decay the satisfaction of the end users. In addition, it is not conducive to grab the valuable information, which is typically usable for decision-making but hidden in the large raw data set. In order to effectively address these problems, a novel spatial-temporal visualization technique based on clustering the original data points is proposed in this paper. The clustering algorithm considers both the spatial-temporal characteristics and the semantic features of the data collected from the transport vehicle during the circulation process. For the spatial aspect, the trajectory is consecutive in nature, and the curves of the trajectory are well guaranteed with the constraint of the temporal factor. As for the spatial perspective, the nearby points are surely clustered together. Besides, the semantic features are taken into account, and then the points with abnormal IoT sensing values are detected in time, which is demanded by the manager of the circulation. In this approach, the original data will be firstly clustered by the proposed clustering algorithm and reduced to relatively fewer points, which are deemed to be critical positions in a specific trajectory on circulation for agricultural products. Then the real-time trajectory of this transport vehicle can be drawn with these critical positions to monitor the environment and trace its position during the circulation process. Furthermore, the proposed spatial-temporal visualization method is applied to the project that focuses on position-based analysis and visualization of agricultural IoT data based on the geographic information system. Finally, the system is successfully applied to several agricultural companies, and the intuitive visualization of the entire trajectory on the circulation process of agricultural products is effectively achieved.","摘要:农产品在流通过程中对运输环境的要求相对严格, 借助物联网技术可以实时感知农产品流通过程中的环境数据以及车辆位置数据, 通过对这些数据进行有效地可视化, 能够实现对整个运输环节的环境监控和位置追踪。但是, 流通过程中往往会产生大规模的环境感知数据和车辆位置数据。直接将这些数据进行可视化映射将面临如下挑战:感知点会显得很繁杂错乱, 容易出现视觉混淆问题;关键位置点会被湮没在密集的点群之中, 难以发现数据中蕴含的有价值的信息;大规模数据的渲染会占用大量的系统计算资源, 导致浏览器卡顿等现象, 影响用户的使用体验。针对这些难题, 该文提出了一种基于聚类的农产品流通过程感知的时空数据可视化技术, 该技术首先综合考虑地理空间分布、时间连续性、语义特性对采集到的大规模数据进行聚类分析, 挖掘出流通过程的关键位置;然后基于这些关键位置绘制运输轨迹, 以实现对流通过程感知数据的时空可视化;最后, 将此技术应用到农业物联网地理空间分析与可视化系统中, 该系统成功应用到浙江省多个农业基地, 针对农业物流环节进行应用示范, 应用表明该技术方便了对农产品流通过程进行直观地时空可视化分析。",作者关键词:agricultural products; clustering algorithms; visualization; circulation process; spatial-temporal data,作者关键词:农产品; 聚类; 可视化; 流通过程; 时空数据
Evaluation method for application of internet of things for aquaculture,水产养殖物联网的应用评价方法,2015,"Internet of things for Aquaculture is an integrated modern system based on computing and communications technology like smart sensor technology, reliable telecommunication, intelligent information processing, which can collect data and images, transmit and process data intelligently, forecast future trend and early-warning for decision support. First of all, it is a key issue to establish scientific and rational index system and evaluation method for internet of things for aquaculture to guarantee its effectiveness. With the rapid development of information technology in China, the internet of things for aquaculture has been promoted and applied in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Guangdong. However, the internet of things for aquaculture in China is at an early stage and there are some problems, which cause negative impact on the promotion and application of the system, for examples, redundant functions, high cost, unstable performances, and so on. Secondly, in order to assess internet of things for aquaculture system, index system to assess internet of things for aquaculture was built in this paper by indicator optimization model to solve randomicity, redundancy, cross-connection and overlap caused subjective selection. Three steps composed of the selection process: 1) first round selection, three categories indices of function indicator, performance indicator and effectiveness indicator, targeted to 40 indicators were selected; 2) second round selection, 40 indicators representing perception layer, transmission layer and application layer, were optimized to 26 by method proposed by Dale and Beyeler, in which the standard conformity degree of each indicator was checked one by one and indicators need to meet at least 5 standards, otherwise they will be eliminated; 3) indicator screening model, by which 26 indicators were reduced to 14, with only 35% of total indicators representing 88.45% of total information, capturing the requirements of completeness and simplicity. Thirdly, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach, which comprise of three levels fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, was established to assess the application of internet of things for aquaculture. Most of the 14 indicators got in the first phase are qualitative factors and difficult to be quantified. That is why fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach was used in this paper. Meanwhile, it is better to adopt multi-level factors as weights are not easy to be assigned reasonably when factors are too many, which leads unreasonable and wrong results. Multi-level fuzzy comprehensive method works well to solve this problem and can be applied to assess function characteristics, performance and effectiveness of the system of internet of things for aquaculture. Multi-level fuzzy comprehensive was built by steps of establishing comment set, membership and got quantitative score A, which can fall into five levels of excellence (A≥82.5), good (82.5>A≥67.5), satisfactory (67.5>A≥52.5), barely adequate (52.5>A≥35) and fail (A<35). Finally, case studies were carried out in Yixing of crab cultivation, Jiangsu province and Zhanjiang of white shrimp cultivation, Guangdong province, in which the index system and multi-level fuzzy comprehensive method were tested based on the internet of things for aquaculture system developed independently by China Agricultural University (CAU). Results showed that the score in Yixing was 87.371 indicating application of internet of things for aquaculture system in Yixing is excellent, meanwhile, the score in Zhanjiang is 74.921, which is good. Both of the two results are consistent with the actual situation of two bases, showing that index system and multi-level fuzzy comprehensive method proposed in this paper are feasible and reasonable for evaluation of application of internet of things for aquaculture and can guide its construction and improvement.","摘要:构建科学合理的水产养殖物联网应用评价指标体系和评价方法, 是保证水产养殖物联网系统发挥最大能效的基础。为解决指标设置随意、冗余、交叉及技术指标过剩的问题, 该文构建了指标筛选模型, 将水产养殖物联网应用评价指标体系从40个优化到14个, 用35%的指标表达了88.45%的信息, 保证了指标体系的完备性和简洁性。同时, 基于模糊评价法构建了水产养殖物联网应用评价模型, 可对水产养殖物联网应用水平进行总体评价以及功能、性能、效益方面的评价。最后, 以江苏宜兴河蟹养殖物联网和广东湛江南美白对虾养殖物联网为实例进行了验证, 宜兴物联网的评价结果为优, 而湛江物联网的评价结果为良, 与实际情况相符, 表明该研究构建的指标体系科学合理, 评价方法可行, 可为水产养殖物联网应用评价提供参考。",作者关键词:aquaculture; indicators; optimization; internet of things; fuzzy evaluation,作者关键词:水产养殖; 指标; 优化; 物联网; 模糊评价
Remote intelligent measurement and control system for granary ventilation based on absolute water potential diagram,基于绝对水势图的粮仓远程智能通风测控系统,2015,"In this paper, a design of intelligent remote monitoring and control system of the granary' based on the absolute water potential theory (AWPT) has been proposed, which is used to improve information and intelligence level of the granary, and reduce the granary administrator's work difficulty. Granary Ventilation Intelligent Decision System (GVIDS) is the realization of this design. GVIDS's program development relies on the Android and the internet of things' technology. Its hardware framework, software framework, the main function modules and operational processes are the main research contents in this paper. The essence of AWPT is the management and control method of granary's mechanical ventilation using water potential diagram proposed by Wu Wenfu et al., which is improved on the basis of the Wu model. In the AWPT, there are three ventilation windows: cooling window, precipitation window and quality adjustment window, and each window corresponds to its appropriate operation mode of ventilation. When using AWPT to guide granary ventilation, the position of the air-temperature-point in the absolute water potential diagram' is observed to determine the need for ventilation, which means that the administrator makes proper ventilation operation according to the ventilation window area that the air-temperature-point falls. The client APP (application) consists of five parts, which are Information Profile module, Absolute Humidity Diagram module, Absolute Water Potential Diagram module, Associated Equipment module andManaging Log module. The Information Profile module is mainly responsible for displaying the basic information of different granaries; the theoretical basis of Absolute Humidity Diagram module is the WU model. First, the client will obtain the latest temperature and humidity data collected from the database. Then, according to the new grain CAE equation and allowing ventilation condition table, calculate and judge whether the current situation needs ventilation. Finally, draw the balanced absolute humidity diagram and balanced relative humidity diagram on the client. Absolute Water Potential Diagram(AWPD) is mainly composed of four curves and one point: absolute potential line of the air, absolute adsorption water potential line of the grains, absolute desorption water potential line of the grains, saturated humidity line of the air, and saturated humidity point of the air (Q). In the AWPD, the area surrounded by the blue lines is the cooling window, the area surrounded by the red line is the precipitation window, and the area surrounded by the green lines is the quality adjustment window. Because the cooling operation and precipitation operation is sometimes performed at the same time, there will be an overlap of the cooling window and precipitation window. Associated Equipment module is used to display the current equipments associated with the state of the work, and the user can remotely control these equipments with the switch buttons.Managing Log module is used for displaying all of the granary operation logs. The client App has so many advantages, such as friendly interface, simple operation, wide adaptability and intelligent and remote control, and it would solve the problem of limited working place for the granary administrator. In the simulated granary loading experiment, the performance of this system is very good, and it should be promoted.","摘要:为了提高粮食仓储中通风作业的管理水平, 并降低粮仓管理员的工作难度, 该文提出了一种基于绝对水势图的粮仓远程智能通风测控系统的设计方案, 采用物联网和Android技术着重研发了粮仓智能通风系统, 并详细阐述了该系统的软硬件框架、主要功能模块及操作流程。绝对水势理论是利用水势图进行粮仓机械通风作业管理和控制的方法。在绝对水势理论中, 提出了3个通风窗口:降温窗口、降水窗口、调质窗口。每个窗口都对应着相应的通风作业模式。当气温状态点在绝对水势图中的位置进入到某一窗口区域中时, 则进行相应的通风作业。相比原始低效的温湿度数据处理方法, 该系统数据用图形化的方式展现, 降低了粮仓管理员的工作难度, 加快了工作效率, 解除了对粮仓管理员工作地点的限制, 并且, 该系统实现了对粮仓的信息化、智能化和远程化控制。在该系统的控制下, 装粮试验中的模拟仓通风效果良好, 并已安全度过长春地区储粮危险期。研究结果为相关粮食仓储工作提供参考。",作者关键词:monitoring; temperature; moisture; internet of things; water potential; intelligent ventilation,作者关键词:监测; 温度; 湿度; 物联网; 水势图; 智能通风

A Reconstruction Algorithm of Wireless Sensor Signal Based on Compressed Sensing,一种基于压缩感知的无线传感信号重构算法,2015,"Compressed sensing(CS)is new theory for sampling and recovering signal based sparse transformation.This theory could help us to acquire complete signal at low cost.Therefore,it also satisfies the requirement of low cost sampling since bandwidth and capability of sampling is not sufficient.However wireless sensor network is an open scene,signal is easily affected by noise in the open environment.Specially,CS theory indicates a method of sub-Nyquist sampling which is effective to reduce cost in the process of data acquirement.However the sampling is ""imperfect"" and the corresponding data is more sensitive to noise.Consequently,it is urgently requisite for robust and antinoise reconstruction algorithms which can ensure the accuracy of signal reconstruction.In the article,we present a proximal gradient algorithm(PRG)to reconstruct Sub-Nyquist sampling signal in the noise environment.This algorithm iteratively uses a straightforward shrinkage step to find the optimum solution of constrained formula.Furthermore it is feasibility to recovering original signal.Finally,in the experiment,PRG shows excellent performance comparing to OMP,BP,and SP while signal is corrupted by noises.","摘要:压缩感知(Compressed Sensing,CS)是一种基于稀疏信号的获取和恢复的新理论,能以较小的采样代价获得完整的信号.这一理论符合无线传感网络在带宽和采集能力局限下需要低代价采样的需求.但由于无线传感网络的开放性,其容易受到环境噪声的影响,特别是采用压缩感知方法进行欠采样,虽然可以减小获取数据的开销,但这种不完整的欠采样数据对噪声更加敏感.因此抗噪声的健壮的重构算法能有效保证信号重构的精度.文中提出了一种近似梯度下降算法(Proximal Gradient Algorithm,PRG)对噪声下的压缩采样信号进行恢复.该算法通过逐步迭代逼近的方式,求得约束方程最优解,进而还原出原信号.通过与OMP、SP、BP算法比较,PRG算法在噪声环境下表现出较好的重构性能.",作者关键词:compressed sensing; sparse reconstruction; wireless sensor network; sub-nyquist sampling; Internet of Things,作者关键词:压缩感知; 稀疏重构; 无线传感网络; 欠采样; 物联网

A New Ownership Transfer Protocol for RFID Tags,一种新的RFID 标签所有权转移协议,2015,"Aiming at the problem of the tags ownership safe transfer during its lifetime,an ownership transfer protocol for Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) is proposed,which is based on the Hash function without the Third Trust Party (TTP). It adopts the challenge-response mechanism,and uses the Status flag to indicate the tag  s owner. In this protocol,the previous owner and the new owner share different secret keys with the target tag respectively, with communication information transferred between them,and the entities in systems can be authenticated.

Analysis result shows that the protocol can satisfy the proposed security requirements for tag ownership transfer. The target tag is owned by the previous owner,and only owned by the new owner after the protocol s execution. So it can make the tag s ownership transfer exclusively.
